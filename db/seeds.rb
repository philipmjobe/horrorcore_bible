Artist.create!(name: "Insane Clown Posse", bio:"Insane Clown Posse (abbreviated as ICP), is an American hip hop duo composed of Violent J (Joseph Bruce) and Shaggy 2 Dope (Joseph Utsler). ICP has earned two platinum and five gold albums. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the entire catalog of the group has sold 6.5 million units in the United States and Canada as of April 2007. The group has established a dedicated following called Juggalos numbering in the 'tens of thousands'. 

Founded in Detroit in 1989, Insane Clown Posse performs a style of hardcore hip hop known as horrorcore and is known for its elaborate live performances. Originally known as JJ Boyz and Inner City Posse, the group introduced supernatural- and horror-themed lyrics as a means of distinguishing itself stylistically. The duo founded the independent record label Psychopathic Records with Alex Abbiss as manager, and produced and starred in the feature films Big Money Hustlas and Big Money Rustlas. They formed their own professional wrestling promotion, Juggalo Championship Wrestling, and later collaborated with many hip hop and rock musicians.

The songs of Insane Clown Posse center thematically on the mythology of the Dark Carnival, a metaphoric limbo in which the lives of the dead are judged by one of several entities. The Dark Carnival is elaborated through a series of stories called Joker's Cards, each of which offers a specific lesson designed to change the 'evil ways' of listeners before 'the end consumes us all'. The original lineup of Insane Clown Posse was John Utsler (John Kickjazz), Joe Bruce (Violent J) and Joey Utsler (Shaggy 2 Dope). John Utsler left before Carnival of Carnage was released in 1992.

Insane Clown Posse's performance style is often described as horrorcore hip hop, which 'utilize shocking (and blatantly over-the-top) narratives to give an over-exaggerated, almost cartoon-like version of urban deprivation in Detroit', according to author Sara Cohen. Bruce and Utsler describe many of their lyrics as being tongue-in-cheek. The group's early work features a raw, minimalistic sound, which later evolved into a more rock-oriented style. The group's lyrics serve as morality tales, with songs focusing on subjects such as cannibalism, murder and necrophilia. Insane Clown Posse's debut album, Carnival of Carnage, features a politically-oriented focus, criticizing elitism and prejudice against those who live in the ghetto, while the album's liner notes criticize the Gulf War. The group's lyrics have opposed racism, bigotry, domestic violence, and child abuse.

Insane Clown Posse has covered songs by Geto Boys, Sly Fox, and Above the Law. Bruce and Utsler refer to Ice Cube, Awesome Dre, Geto Boys, and Esham as influences on their own music, while Bruce has expressed admiration for Gong, Pearl Jam, and Michael Jackson. Mike E. Clark's production for the group incorporates elements such as 'carnival organ riffs, power chords and shotgun blasts…banjolike plucking and Van Halen-esque guitar squeals', while Bruce and Utsler sometimes alternate between rapping and screaming. Bruce has credited pop music as an influence on some of the group's material, even terming the music 'Wicked Pop'. Bruce has also stated 'We do our own genre of music'. In his review of The Tempest, Allmusic's David Jeffries writes that Bruce and Utsler 'in a carnival barker fashion that fits with their circus motif, their Insane Clown disguises, and Mike E. Clark's big top-inspired production.' Insane Clown Posse has influenced similar acts, such as Axe Murder Boyz, Blaze Ya Dead Homie and Boondox.

Artist.create!(name: "Necro", bio: " Ron Raphael Braunstein (born June 7, 1976), better known by his stage-name Necro, is an American rapper from Brooklyn. He is the owner of Psycho+Logical-Records founded November 1999. He is the younger brother of rapper Ill Bill.

Necro was born in Brooklyn, New York and grew up in the Glenwood Houses, where he lived for eight years from about 6 years old to age 14, when he moved to Canarsie. Born into a Jewish family, he is the son of Israeli expatriates, with ancestry from Israel and Romania. Necro's father was a Romanian-born Israeli soldier and his mother an Orthodox baal teshuva.

He began his musical career at 11, playing in a death metal band named Injustice. He made a transition from heavy metal to hip hop. In 1988, he started rapping after being influenced by his older brother, rapper Ill Bill. Necro derived his stage-name from the Slayer song 'Necrophiliac'. Before that he called himself 'Mad Mooney', which was a character from a Clive Barker book. He made his first demo in about 1990 and won a demo battle contest on the Stretch Armstrong and Bobbito show on WKCR-FM. In about 1993 Necro started rapping full-time and made a demo called 'Do The Charles Manson'. In 1995 he proceeded to rap on the Wildman Steve and DJ Riz show WBAU 90.3FM.

Necro plays a hip-hop subgenre called horrorcore. He has played rap metal and has combined rap with death metal music. Necro refers to his music as 'death rap' to describe his style of ultraviolent hip hop and to distinguish himself from other genre labels created by the media. His music combines death metal beats with explicit raps about violence, death, the occult, drugs and sex.

Necro is known for releasing conceptual songs. Songs have tackled topics like the Manson murders: 'Creepy Crawl' 'Cockroaches', 'Scalpel', 'The 12 King Pimp Commandments', 'Dead Body Disposal', 'The Human Traffic King', 'White Slavery' 'I Need Drugs', 'Food For Thought', 'S.T.D.', picking up women ('86 Measures of Game'), cannibalism ('Human Consumption'), suicide ('You Did It'), bondage and sex games ('EdgePlay'), watersports and micturition ('Piss'), life as a pimp ('Out the Pocket'), a revenge tale ('Some Get Back (Revenge)'), and war narratives ('First Blood').

Necro is a devoted fan of the 1983 film Scarface. Necro sampled the main character from Scarface, Tony Montana, in 'Cockroaches'. Necro has also rapped, 'I live scarface scenes' in 'Gory Days', and rapped Montana's infamous quote, 'you fuck with me you fucking with the best', whilst sampling the quote simultaneously in 'asBESTos'. Necro also took the title from 'Push It to the Limit' which appeared in the film's soundtrack and used the title for his own song 'Push it to the Limit'. Al Pacino's work besides Scarface plays a recurrent theme throughout Necro's work. Necro's new collaboration with Kool G Rap is called The Godfathers as is the movie The Godfather that made a star of Al Pacino. In 'asBESTos', Necro raps, 'I'm completely rehabilitated, reinvigorated, reassimilated' which is taken directly from an Al Pacino quote in Carlito's Way.", image: "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wQUp4rTRL._SX355_.jpg")
Artist.create!(name: "Gravediggaz", bio: "Gravediggaz was an American hip-hop group from New York City, known for its dark sense of humor and abrasive, menacing soundscapes. Gravediggaz blended hardcore hip hop, gangsta rap and heavy metal with horror elements to pioneer the hip-hop subgenre of horrorcore. 

The group was formed in 1992, bringing together Prince Paul (The Undertaker), Frukwan (The Gatekeeper), Poetic (The Grym Reaper) and RZA (The RZArector). It came about largely due to the efforts of Prince Paul. Frukwan and Prince Paul were previously together in the group Stetsasonic. According to Frukwan, the group's name means 'digging graves of the mentally dead, and it stood for resurrecting the mentally dead from their state of unawareness and ignorance.' The group's lyrics mix black humor (regarding topics such as suicide, death, killing, psychopathy, hell, etc.), criticism regarding the music industry, cartoonish violence reminiscent of the Geto Boys, and esoteric references to the Nation of Gods and Earths. The group pioneered the horrorcore genre.

The group's first album was originally to be titled Niggamortis; however, this potentially risqué title was changed to 6 Feet Deep for the American market (European versions of the album retained the original title, and also included the bonus track 'Pass the Shovel'); it was released on August 9, 1994. The four members adopted Gravedigga alter egos for their work with the group: RZA became The RZArector, Poetic became The Grym Reaper, Prince Paul became The Undertaker, and Frukwan became The Gatekeeper. In 1995, the three rapping members (without Prince Paul) released a collaborative EP titled 'The_Hell_E.P.' with UK trip hop artist Tricky.

The second full-length Gravediggaz album The Pick, the Sickle and the Shovel was less humorous, dealing more with social and political issues; it also used calmer and more conventional production. Prince Paul played a considerably smaller role in the making of this album, with many of the production duties now taken care of by RZA and his Wu-Tang affiliates (including True Master and 4th Disciple).

A bootleg Gravediggaz album surfaced in 1998, called Scenes From The Graveyard. It featured seven unreleased tracks plus some remixes from the first two albums.

Gravediggaz recruited DJ Diamond J. Poetic died of colon cancer in July 2001. Frukwan stated in an interview not long after Poetic's death that a new album using leftover Poetic material would be released. Nightmare in A-Minor, the third official album for Gravediggaz, came out in 2001; it featured two of the original members, Poetic and Frukwan. This album was their darkest work yet, including many references to Poetic's struggle with cancer, as well as apocalyptic themes to do with the teachings of the Five Percent Nation. Although RZA did not take part in the album, some Wu-Tang Clan affiliates such as 4th Disciple, True Master and Beretta 9 were involved. The album was mostly produced by Poetic and Frukwan. A different version of the album (minus the song 'Better Wake Up') was released in 2002, for which some of the tracks created by Poetic were replaced or altered.

In 2003 Frukwan released his debut solo album, Life. The fourth Gravediggaz album 6 Feet Under was released in 2004 by Cleopatra Records and featured songs from Nightmare in A-Minor and Life. According to Frukwan, he had nothing to do with the release and claimed that song titles were changed without permission, making it an unauthorized release.

In 2010, Gravediggaz recorded a new song, '2 More Cups of Blood'. In 2011, it was announced that the group had been recording new tracks involving Shabazz The Disciple & Killah Priest.

In 2018, Gatekeeper released '1 Cup of Blood' under the Gravediggaz name.", image: "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wQUp4rTRL._SX355_.jpg")

Twiztid's debut album, Mostasteless, was originally released independently by Psychopathic in 1997, but was pulled, then re-released a year later on Twiztid's new label; Island with a somewhat different track listing as a result of uncleared samples in a few songs in the original release.

Artist.create!(name: "Tech N9ne", bio: "Aaron Dontez Yates (born November 8, 1971 in Kansas City, Missouri), better known by his stage name Tech N9ne or Tecca Nina is an American rapper, co-owner of Strange Music Records and actor. His career has spanned over 24 years, during which he has released eleven albums. According to the He's a Mental Giant Songfacts, his stage name originated from the TEC-9 semi-automatic handgun, given to him by rapper Black Walt due to his fast rhyming style. (Tech is short for technique and 9 is the number of completion. That's why he says the technique's complete so often.)

His tenth studio album, K.O.D., was released October 27, 2009. He has spent his illustrious career making sure he`s been grinding harder than the average rapper, and is the best selling artist out of his hometown. With nine solo albums and two powerhouse collaboration projects under his belt, the Kansas City MC`s flow is sharper and slicker than it`s ever been.
“This is another roller coaster ride,” explains TECH N9NE about the release. “When it came time for Sickology 101, I knew I wanted to do a collabo album based on the study of being sick. It`s a beginner`s course for people who don`t know how to be sick lyrically or how to choose sick beats. It all starts with beats because they tell me exactly what to do.” Epic beats from YoungFyre, Wyshmaster, Seven and Matic Lee set the stage for TECH N9NE to weave his introspective and sometimes roguish lyrics around.

Sickology 101 brims with stellar appearances from lyrical heavyweights. On the opening title track, TECH N9NE slays alongside Chino XL and Crooked I, pulling listeners into the Hip-Hop classroom for a lesson in murdering a beat. It`s a twisted vision forged on undeniable grooves and quixotic wordplay.

The single, “Nothin,`” is an inspiring, honest anthem that features Messy Marv and Big Scoob. Meanwhile, on “Midwest Choppers 2,” TECH N9NE and Krayzie Bone cruise to the depths of darkness. “Krayzie Bone came through and murdered it,” says TECH N9NE. “I modeled the song after movies. When you do a sequel, there has to be a bigger body count and more people have to die. 'Midwest Choppers 2` is Autobahn-style. It makes you want to speed.”

TECH N9NE`s inimitable flow and rhyming take center stage on solo tracks, including the haunting, hypnotic “Red Nose.” He doesn`t pull any punches on the vitriolic, YoungFyre-produced “Blown Away,” either. It`s an open letter to several prominent urban artists who refused to play before him at radio festivals despite his massive concert draw.

With hits like “I`m A Playa,” “Caribou Lou” (which boasts 7.2 million MySpace plays), “Riotmaker,” “Like Yeah” and “Everybody Move,” it`s no wonder TECH N9NE counts a total of over 4.5 million YouTube video plays and an average of 40,000 MySpace visitors each day. His success knows no limits. The July 2008 release, Killer, debuted at Number 1 on the Billboard Top Independent Albums chart and Number 12 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart. He did it all on his own. There was no major label — just TECH N9NE`s own record company, Strange Music. TECH N9NE`s tracks have appeared in films like Gang Related and Alpha Dog as well as various TV shows, and he recently made his motion picture debut in The Life of Lucky Cucumber alongside members of MTV`s “Jackass” crew.

It hasn`t been an easy road, but TECH N9NE soldiers on and he`ll never stop. “They call me devil worshipper because I`m different. I give you music for my core. They`re the people that put me over the million mark. I raise my middle finger to everybody who judges me because my core audience is there for me. They will always love me, but I`m trying to reach others, too. It`s not over. My music is supposed to be for everybody, but some people just don`t get it. This album is the result; swallow it. It`s middle finger music, all-day and all-night.”

TECH N9NE never stops bringing that music directly to his fans, constantly reinforcing his status as one of the hardest-touring rap acts in the business. In 2008, TECH N9NE performed over 200 shows and he doesn`t show any signs of slowing down in 2009. In April, TECH will head out in support of Sickology 101 and spend two months on the road, performing live for his rabid fans.

Sickology 101 is prepping the world for TECH N9NE`s next masterpiece, K.O.D. “I want people to know that I`m getting better and better and I`m a machine. I do these collabo albums to give the fans more. This is a bridge record to K.O.D. It`s the farewell to the TECH N9NE you`ve known lately. It`s getting darker. A lot of people might not be able to go to the place I`m going, but this place is my specialty.”

“I don`t need people to kiss my hand,” assures TECH N9NE. “I`m not trippin` on status, and I`m not a narcissist when it comes to rap. It`s my heart and soul pouring onto the paper. I write my life and I can`t hold back. This is what I know.”", image: "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Tech-N9ne-2018-cr-denny-illic-billboard-1548.jpg")

Artist.create!(name: "Brotha Lynch Hung", bio: "Brotha Lynch Hung (born Kevin Mann) is an MC and producer from Sacramento, CA who began rapping at 13. Lynch Hung's lyrics are notorious for featuring highly explicit themes, including murder, rape and cannibalism. Lynch Hung debuted with the 1993 album 24 Deep, which featured stories of the struggles involved with being affiliated with a local street gang in Sacramento's 'Garden Blocc.' Lynch Hung has also helped Master P with albums like I'm Bout It, E-40's Southwest Riders and Mr. Serv-On's Life Insurance. Lynch's first known work is his production for X-Raided's 'Niggas In Blacc' (91) and the callaboration album 'Nigga Deep' with Triple Sicx Bounty, released in 1992 and re-released in 1998.

Brotha Lynch Hung has been described as the creator of the 'horrorcore rap genre', and has sold 1.4 million cds independently. His rapping style has been described as smooth and quickly delivered.

Some listeners argue that Lynch Hung's 24 Deep album defines his musical style, but Lynch Hung has said in interviews and online forums that it does not.

Lynch Hung's second album Season of Da Siccness in 1995 proved to be the one of the most gruesome and mysogynistic Gangsta Rap albums ever released, graphically chronicling a life of drug use and sale, promiscuity, ultra-violence, rape, infanticide, and supposed cannibalism. This is Lynch's most commercially successful album, as it has now achieved gold album sales status.

Lynch Hung's lyrics are described as sicc -\ having the same meaning as the word sick but utilizing the double 'C' which is characteristic of local Crip gangsters (loccs) in Sacramento, CA and other parts of California. Lynch has stated in his song '24 Gone' that he himself is a Crip, residing in Crip areas of Sacramento has had an influence on his lyrics. He has been in gang confrontations, and he was shot once. He describes his real life experiences in his lyrics. He has since released Loaded in 1997. The next Lynch album was released in 2000 called EBK4 after a dispute with Black Market Records. The label allegedly restricted his creativity by featuring artists on the album against Lynch's will. Lynch asked his fans not to buy the album. He said 'I don't care how they get it just don't buy it or steal it'. Brotha Lynch released the DVD of Now Eat in 2000, which features a bloodthirsty and cannibalistic Lynch who goes on a rampage, killing and eating many people.

Lynch released Blocc Movement and Virus in 2001, Appearances: Book 1 in 2002, and in that same summer of 2002 he released his first DVD, Plague. Lynch's newer work includes Lynch by Inch: Suicide Note and Uthanizm in 2003, and the Now Eat DVD in 2000. In 2006 he released a collaboration with rapper MC Eiht entitiled 'The New Season.'

In May 2009, Mann signed a three album deal with Midwest rapper Tech N9ne's Strange Music label. In March 2010, he released his Strange Music debut, Dinner and a Movie, selling around 7,000 copies during its first week. His second Strange album, Coathanga Strangla, was released a year later in April 2011, and his third album with Strange Music, Mannibalector was released on February 5, 2013. The Horror-inspired trilogy told a fictional story of a crazed cannibalistic serial killer, struggling with life, family and the urge to kill. Each album debuted on the Billboard 200, and featured acts such as Snoop Dogg, Yelawolf, Hopsin and Tech N9ne among others. Following the release of the third album, Strange Music offered Mann a contract extension to keep him on the label.", image: "https://bandwagmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Lynch-Blood-All-Over-Me-1.jpg")
Artist.create!(name: "Dark Lotus", bio: "Dark Lotus is an American hip-hop supergroup based in Detroit, Michigan. Formed in 1998, the group consists of Psychopathic Records-associated rappers Joseph Bruce and Joseph Utsler of Insane Clown Posse, Jamie Spaniolo and Paul Methric of Twiztid, and Blaze Ya Dead Homie.

Dark Lotus made its debut with the single 'Echo Side', which was later released on Insane Clown Posse's 1999 album The Amazing Jeckel Brothers. It was later announced that each member 'would act as a 'petal' of the lotus,' and that there would be six members. After speculation as to who the sixth member would be, including rumors that Esham would join the group, it was announced that Marz would be a member.
  
Dark Lotus released their first album, Tales from the Lotus Pod, in 2001. Mike E. Clark was brought in to produce the album, but left the project after producing four songs, and Fritz the Cat produced the rest of the album. The album peaked at #1 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart, #6 on the Top Independent Albums chart, and #158 on the Billboard 200. Marz left the group, and was replaced by James Lowery. In 2002, Tales from the Lotus Pod was reissued in a new version removing Marz' vocals. On April 6, 2004, Dark Lotus released their second studio album, Black Rain.

It peaked at #4 on the Top Independent Albums chart, #23 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, #45 on the Top Internet Albums chart, and #45 on the Billboard 200. Allrovi reviewer Stewart Mason praised the album, writing 'Nothing on The Opaque Brotherhood will convince anyone who isn't already a fan, but the tormented lyrics and matter-of-fact delivery remove a layer or two of distance and artifice from the band's familiar themes, and make them that much more disturbing as a result.'.", image: "https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/ar0/4979182ee8f847a6c72ac1e82003a25a.jpg")

Tac and Hash continued to write songs in their own unique style. Although their music was mainly influenced by hip-hop, its intensity suggests the presence of a rock influence as well.

Their 2007 album entitled Truth In Lies is one of their most lyrically advanced albums to date and features some of the underground's most popular artists.

Artist.create!(name: "ADR Lavey", bio: "San Francisco native born and raised, started off as a DJ. Then I was recruited by a local group Polynesian Posse and at 16 was when I first stepped into a recording studio. Was approached by a childhood friend to do production and DJ work for. Friend and that's when Triple 666 was created.

Process of us recording the album little by little I started approaching the mic and I've been on the mic ever since. I bring a dark entity to the music. I try to take you on an emotional roller coaster and paint a real graphic picture for my fans.
  
Triple 666 was founded at Bank Roll Studios in San Francisco in 1991, by Fila Phil, Undertaker and myself. Then we picked Face Dog and SOS, as of now the group is no longer together, but everyone is just a phone call away if we decide we want to do any projects together.
  
“Nothing But Reality” was never pressed in a CD format. That project consisted of a few songs, the majority of the songs just featured Fila Phil only, the rest of the group was only in one song. We were testing the waters to see how people would react to it. What can be heard is a lot of street tales, from drug dealing, murder and pimp tales.

Artist.create!(name: "Anybody Killa", bio: "James Lowery (born June 26, 1973), also known as Anybody Killa, or ABK, is a rapper from Detroit, Michigan, whose stage persona is that of a Native American warrior. He is signed to Psychopathic Records. Prior to performing as ABK he performed as Native Funk.

Lowery was raised on the east side of Detroit. His parents were from Pembroke, North Carolina. Lowery's father was a preacher. His aunt and mother taught him about Native American heritage, telling him Cherokee and Lumbee legends and teaching him about dreamcatchers. Lowery started making music at a young age, using anything he could find as instruments, and began writing his own songs at the age of 13. By the age of 15, local kids were paying to watch him perform in his garage.

In 1995, he formed the group Krazy Klan with childhood friend Lavel, performing as Jaymo and J-ho, respectively. During this period, Lowery worked at a side plant that produced parts for Chrysler. His middle finger was partially cut off in an accident. After releasing two albums independently and performing at local clubs and parties, Krazy Klan broke up.

Since going solo, Lowery has released one album under the alias Native Funk, countless solo albums as ABK, as well as working on collaborative group albums with fellow emcees — Drive-By with Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Detroit Warriors with Strict 9, and The Hav Knots with Big Hoodoo.

He has also been a part of the supergroup Dark Lotus and went on to form another record label, Native World Inc., releasing albums from various other artists throughout the years.", image: "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/rap/images/6/69/Abk.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130520210450")

Artist.create!(name: "Army of the Pharaohs", bio: "Army of the Pharaohs (most commonly abbreviated as AOTP or A.O.T.P.) is an American underground hip hop collective originating from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, formed by Jedi Mind Tricks founder Vinnie Paz in 1998. The collective has strong links to other underground east coast groups such as Outerspace, Snowgoons, La Coka Nostra, Demigodz, 7L & Esoteric, and JuJu Mob. AOTP's affiliations and member roster has changed several times since its formation.

Paz formed the outfit in the late 1990s with the original roster of Bahamadia, Chief Kamachi, Virtuoso, 7L & Esoteric, plus Jedi Mind Tricks' other member Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind. The group first released the “Five Perfect Exertions” and “War Ensemble” 12″ on Paz's short-lived Recordings in 1998, but then the underground supergroup remained silent for several years.

After a couple of successful Jedi Mind Tricks albums and a new deal with Babygrande by 2003, Paz resurrected the crew, adding OuterSpace, Celph Titled, Reef the Lost Cauze, King Syze, Des Devious, and Apathy; however, Stoupe, Bahamadia, and Virtuoso had defected from the group. Babygrande issued their “Tear It Down” 12″ and first album, The Torture Papers, in 2006. The 2007 follow-up album, Ritual of Battle, saw Jus Allah and JMT protégés Doap Nixon and Demoz joining the Pharaohs.

The Unholy Terror was released in March 2010. This album marked the return of Apathy and the addition of two new AOTP members, Block McCloud and Journalist. Two songs, “Godzilla” and “Contra Mantra”, were released before the album. This album also marked the departure of Chief Kamachi who left the group because of business issues and an apparent feud with Vinnie Paz and Apathy.

In early 2011, Paz announced on his Facebook page that In Death Reborn is due to be released in 2012, however the date was pushed back and almost seemed like it was never going to be released. Early in 2012, Houston underground MC VZilla and Connecticut's Blacastan were added to the group. Both artists have made names for themselves with their features and album releases in 2012. In Death Reborn was eventually released in April 2014. The album featured members Vinnie Paz, Apathy, Blacastan, Block McCloud, Celph Titled, Demoz, Des Devious, Doap Nixon, Esoteric, Lawrence Arnell, King Magnetic, King Syze, OuterSpace, Reef the Lost Cauze, and VZilla.

Artist.create!(name: "A-Game", bio: "A-Game is a recording artist originally from Bradenton, Florida hailing from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Pursuing a career in music was a dream that A-Game had since he was only 5 years old. At age 14, that dream quickly became reality when he began investing into recording equipment, actively seeking out criticism of his early work from peers who weren't afraid to hurt feelings and be brutally honest, which was something an introverted, shy teen just starting out needed to hear to improve.

Eventually, A-Game reunited with an old friend from high school who recently just got out of juvenile hall known as The Bird, and began making music on an almost daily basis under the group Zoo Crew, which had over 20 members at one point in time. Shortly after, Bird and A-Game began forming their own supergroup, known as “Skrewz Loose” which was a duo group formed by the two. At age 16, his first time performing live was when Hopsin pulled him onstage to rap next to him in front of a sold out show of 2,000 plus people. A nerve-racking experience, but this ultimately was A-Game's breakthrough. By that time next year, he was already doing shows in his local Florida scene, dominating stages in Saint Petersburg, Tampa, Orlando, and more.
  
In 2017, A-Game became an official member of Judah Priest (Wu-Tang Clan's Brooklyn Zu/Zu Bulliez)'s 144,000 Chosen Few, beginning to do shows more frequently in the northeast and quickly building a following in the Philly/New Jersey hip hop scene. In 2019, A-Game left the Chosen Few to pursue his own path.
  
Fast forward to now, he has performed multiple times in over half the United States of America. He currently has 5 mixtapes released, and 2 albums.

Artist.create!(name: "Bake Lo", bio: "Charles baker (born on march 1st, 1994), better known by his stage name Bake Lo, has been quoted to be one of the hardest working artists around. Not only because of the immense energy that he brings to the stage and microphone, but also because of what he does behind the scenes. He has a willingness to work that leave some intimidated. This artist comes hardcore with an intricate but clear way of rhyming with his very own, unique style of music. Growing up in the small but mighty city of Ecorse, MI wasn't always easy. Other than being located on the outskirts of Detroit, the city was riddled with problems.

Growing up in a low income household taught Bake the struggles of adulthood early on in his life. Between having to start working at a young age to help his family's income and living in a household that was on the verge of falling apart; he learned. He learned that life was going to be a roller coaster that he might not be able to hold on to. Regardless, he did not let it stop him. He was soon introduced to the idea of making music by his childhood friend Bradly Gibson (RIP), who originally got Bake Lo into recording his first few songs. At first, the songs were nonsense because Bake couldn't quite find his sound. It wasn't until he was arrested at age 15 and sent to a juvenile facility to really reflect on his life when he finally channeled his inner emotion into his writing,

At that point, he began to feel a release when writing about his life and the struggles around him. It was soon that he began to master his unique sound of Wicked Truth. He was eventually introduced to an artist by the name of Ikkurruz that really helped Bake Lo get the initial push that he needed. He officially booked Bake Lo for his first show in 2011 and Bake made sure that he sold every single ticket that he was given, plus more, which lead to bigger opportunities. One opportunity in which he met his soon to be (Native World Inc) label partner, Anybody Killa. Leaving behind his job at a liquor store, Bake Lo did his first national tour at the age of 17 with ABK and Blaze Ya Dead Homie as Drive By. He later went on to do countless tours and shows throughout the span of a couple years with many other artists.", image: "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6761610000e5eb860a9f73cf95cc27226a1ab7")

Artist.create!(name: "Bankrupt Records", bio: "Bankrupt Records began as a closet experiment in rural Georgia, as brothers James G and JG (collectively known as DUO) began creating music out of their closet with limited funds and no financial support. The duo created Bankrupt Records, a launchpad to release music and named it so for the lack of money and finances involved in creating the music.

The DUO collaborated with local artists, such as the Medicine Man and Big C, and released a 2005 album titled “Underground Mythology.” Bankrupt Records would begin performing live and began spreading their influence across Georgia and the Southeast. Bankrupt soon teamed up with the rap group Southern Hustlas Incorporated (SHI) based out of Covington, Georgia and released a super group album titled “The League” featuring Bankrupt, SHI, and West Virginia artist Sike Sick. This album was very successful and sold thousands of physical units and lead to Bankrupt opening shows for acts such as D12, Twiztid, Hed PE, Kottonmouth Kings, Blaze, ABK, and Gangsta Boo, and performing at musical festivals such as Strictly for the Wicked and The Gathering.

Bankrupt would then release their first all DUO project, “Night Vision,” and would continue to tour the underground scene in the Southeast, hitting local pubs, bars, parties, and bigger venues. Bankrupt Records would then release their first professionally recorded studio album, “Double Vision,” featuring appearances from Hopsin, Bizarre, Bizzy Bone, Lil Wyte, Royce da 5'9″, and others, and would go on to do extremely well and further their influence across the South.

Bankrupt also released another GA compilation titled “Gods and Generals” and helped shed light on rising talent such as Rittz by providing a mixtape to push and shows to network and perform on.

Then he attempted to kill himself twice. The funny part is that both times music saved his life. The first was a song called “Gore Hop,” which was rapped by both Hex Rated and Insane Poetry.
  
And the second time was from Statik G's ALL OUT OF NORMAL album. However, this was never in his playlist. It just was randomly added. The song that saved his life from that album was “Night Without End.”

Artist.create!(name: "Bootleg", bio: "Dayton Family founder Bootleg not only made a name for himself in the Midwest hardcore rap underground as a member of the infamous Flint, MI, group but also as a solo artist. While many MCs rap about crime and the gangsta lifestyle, few can actually back up their talk. No stranger to crime or prison, Bootleg is one of the few hardcore rappers who speaks directly from experience. It's this sincerity and experience that sets him apart from his wannabe peers, making him one of the Midwest's most notorious hardcore rappers.

After joining forces with fellow Flint MCs Shoestring and Matt Hinkle, Bootleg tagged the trio the Dayton Family in commemoration of the shady, crime-ridden street they called home. By 1995 the trio had released their first album, What's on My Mind?, followed a year later by the gold-selling F.B.I. While both albums generated a substantial amount of attention and hype in the underground hardcore rap scene, the law unfortunately intervened, and the group members soon found themselves behind bars for various crimes. Of course, prison wasn't a new experience for Bootleg. In fact, he'd spent the greater part of the '90s behind bars, accumulating priceless experiences that fueled his criminal-minded rhymes.
  
Once Bootleg finally got out of prison, he used every free moment to work on his solo debut, 1999's Death Before Dishonesty. Unfortunately, partly because of the three-year interval since F.B.I., Bootleg's debut didn't sell as well as hoped for, and Relativity Records quickly parted ways with the troubled rapper. In 2001, Bootleg returned to the rap game, though, joining forces with the Detroit-based Overcore label (Esham, Natas).

Over the last 5 or so years as of this writing, Tha Butcher has consistently evolved, expanded, and broadened his skill level as far as lyrics, content, and overall variety of styles.
  
His drive and motivation has led to him getting signed to Klinikly Dead Entertainment as of early 2021.
  
His “go to” is, has been, and always will be, tha dark side.
  
His literal intelligence and knowledge level of “certain things” we'll just say, is indicated and hinted at, throughout his entire career.
  
With an extensive criminal record and 3 decades worth of inpatient hospitalizations, it's definitely safe to say, Tha Butcher is not only an artist, but a human/demon hybrid, that you would definitely want on your side, and/or on your team.
  
This is 110% an individual you do NOT want to confront in real life.
  
The lyrics are not a gimic by any means. This is real life self expression, of what has ALREADY BEEN, seen, done, or thought about.
  
No longer the “new guy” in the underground, Tha Butcher has made it his life's mission, to not only EARN but to COMMAND his respect.
Not only in music, but in life.
  
Tha Butcher takes this VERY seriously.
  
And his music, will ALWAYS be, a reflection of his REAL LIFE STORY.

He started horrorcore music at a very young age when he was in the 8th grade in the year of 2006; he progressed more and more until he became serious with his music and started recording it for the first time when he graduated out of High School in the year of 2010. He had contacted with a local producer named Soerangit Aniff aka Mo from his hometown of San Jose, CA who actually has been working with a lot of well known talented MCs including Kung Fu Vampire (once) and producing beats. Chuckklez started out with one of his very dark tracks that he wrote “Mental Patient©” which is actually an influence by real life Psychopaths, Murderers and parts of his childhood memories. But he wanted it to be kept in the darkness until the time was right and started writing more Sick music for his pleasure. Since then in 2011, he finally released it along with a new track “Keep the Heads and Eat the Rest©” which was inspired by the movie Sin City and became well known in the underground today.
  
He has worked and collaborated with one of the most well known and talented MCs from the U.S. to overseas such as Scum, Insane Poetry, Dosia Demon, DJ Lil Sprite, Zomb' G, Skyler Torquemada (Italy), Kaotic Klique, Dark Half, Legacey, Wolff, Phr0zen, Omega Sin, Insane Loc, Bloodshot, KGP, MC Cumblood from Butchers Harem, 089 Clique, Rozz Dyliams, and much much more.

Artist.create!(name: "Creech", bio: "Creech is an artist from the Netherlands. Creech, formerly “Creature C,” started to dislike that name as the “C” didn't have a meaning and he wanted to have a catchier name. At some point, Cyanide (R.I.P.) called Creature C “Creech” and he liked that, so he stuck with that name. He developed his style in the golden era by listening to old school hip-hop over and over again. Growing up with four brothers meant that Creech was always surrounded by different forms of music.

His first intro to hip-hop came when he heard Kool Moe Dee's “Go See The Doctor” performed by other kids during a performance in a classroom. A few years later, he joined a basketball club and joined a hip-hop group called Black Pound.

At that time, Creech started buying music equipment. With that, he started mixing beats with any mixable melody he liked. As the group Black Pound disappeared, Creech continued solo.

Creech discovered a section at MP3.com where artists posted horrorcore hip-hop. From there, he discovered a forum board called horrorcore.com where he met other horrorcore artists and beatmakers. That's when Creech started buying beats from skilled producers such as Bob e. Nite, DJ Shy One, Bad Mind, and Komatose.

Creech always dug the dark side of hip-hop and that's been his style for a long while. At some point Creech had a different alias, “Rawhead Rex.” Rawhead Rex only recorded one song and it was never released, only online.

As Creech got older, he started to get a little tired of writing horrorcore lyrics, and so he started to write lyrics about other things as well. He also started rapping in Dutch because he felt that rapping in his native language was more natural and that way he didn't have to concentrate too much on the pronunciation of English words.

Old school hip-hop is the music Creech knows best and it's fair to say that the Ultramagnetic MC's, BDP, Tim Dog, the Geto Boys, and Desmond Dekker are his biggest influences. Although Creech is hip-hop through and through, it is not to say he finds himself restricted to this genre. In fact his influences are vast, which is noticeable throughout his albums, especially his debut release.", image: "https://i0.wp.com/horrorcorewiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/creech.jpg?w=339&ssl=1")

Then while vacationing in VA Beach, VA in 2000 and producer-less, he met a producer by the name of Gemini da Golden Child, owner of Gemini Productions, who in turn was on the verge of giving it all up after difficulties ranging from disloyal artists to snakes in the business.

Artist.create!(name: "DamneDNatioN", bio: "DamneDNatioN has been writing, preparing and recording since 1999. The group was first established as Concussion and soon changed their name to a more fitting DamneDNatioN.

In 2005, they performed their first big show with King Gordy, Psycho Jesus, and other local artists.
  
In between shows, they have been recording, making music videos, etc.
  
In 2006 and 2007, DamneDNatioN started working on solo material during the recording of new music together. Some of which has been performed at various events.
  
DamneDNatioN took some time in 2007 [and beyond] to work at haunted houses in Indianapolis, making new connections each year.
  
Upon releasing new music in 2008, they still continued to perform at a large ammounts of shows.
  
In 2009, the quality of DamneDNatioN's music began to improve, shifting from what they would describe as “decent” to crystal clear. In 2010, the plan of getting an LLC was in place with the desire to start their own label. This finally happened in 2011, leading to also signing additional artists to the roster. In 2013, music videos for DamneDNatioN's “Wasps in my Brain” and Highly Xplicit's “Church Burners” featuring Mr. Lokust and DamneDNatioN were filmed. That same year, DBR, the label, was laid to rest.
  
The year 2013 was still filled with good shows and good music, but a new home was needed for the two emcees. They (and some fellow artists) decided that it was way overdue for DamneDNatioN to join forces with Shadow Walkaz Ent., so they did so in late 2014.
  
DamneDNatioN have always been heavily influenced by a wide variety of music and have pushed themselves through the years to always sound unlike any other artist. Their delivery them has always been unique and unmatched to anything else in the state; They don't sound like every other hip hopper in the city.
  
With horror concepts laced over dark club beats or sinister sounds, they have raised the bar for themselves consistently for years.
  
Upon working with Shadow Walkaz Ent. (Highly Xplicit, The Lyrical Freakshow and Mr. Lokust) DamneDNatioN has progressed and upped their game, proving once again that they can butcher with the best of them.
  
In 2015, Shadow Walkaz showed signs of dissipating, so measures were taken and 3rd Shift Entertainment wanted to do a joint venture with SWE and other labels. The joint venture didn't work out in the long run, but DN's LP, “Illuminated,” was successfully released on SWE and 3SE.
  
In 2016, the group signed with DurtiMyndz Ent. and Released “Satan's Hymen,” along with a video for “Lake of Fire,” among other things. They have been consistently creating and releasing ever since.
  
DamneDNatioN has done shows with countless artists including:
Potluck, Glasses Malone, J Hornay, Lil Wyte, Scum, Smallz One, Mastamind, Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid, Dark Half, Leaders of the Lost, Mars, Polk Frost, Kutt Kalhoun, !Mayday!, Damien Quinn, King Gordy, Esham, Blaze ya Dead Homie, ABK, The R.O.C, A.X.E, DJ Clay, Boondox, Lo Key, Prozak, Zug Izland, Twisted Insane, Bloodshot, KGP, Con-Crete, Stitch Mouth, Psycho Jesus, Mistah Fab, Young Wicked, Bukshot, Ouija Macc, and The Dirtball.", image: "https://i.discogs.com/iPWgt-uyjF22lvOaxO9tPzqGqv30LYCODAT2h5fHXpM/rs:fit/g:sm/q:40/h:300/w:300/czM6Ly9kaXNjb2dz/LWRhdGFiYXNlLWlt/YWdlcy9BLTU5MzA1/ODktMTUzMDU5MzE5/OC00NzU4LmpwZWc.jpeg")

It also contained production from Fritz The Cat and Stir Crazy. The group would spend the next year promoting and creating the next project “Nightmarez.” The group refused to release any information about the album including a release date.

Artist.create!(name: "Dead Poets", bio: "Dead Poets is an American hip hop duo from New Jersey, consisting of rapper/producer “Tab” and rapper “Renagade”. They perform both as the group, Dead Poets, and independently in an array of venues.

Based from Roselle, NJ, they have built an impressive following within the Tri-State area and are expanding rapidly across the country. They were originally known as “Dead Poet Society”, but later changed the group's name to “Dead Poets”. The group's style consists true to the hip-hop foundation of lyrical skills with themes across the board, from love and hate to the urban party scene.
  
With a large portion of the production done by “Tab”, the self-taught musician (guitars, live drums, programming) uses a mixture of samples and live instruments to create boom-bap heavy melodic tunes, infusing anything from old school rap to rock to reggae. Their infused melodies are complimented well with sung hooks by both. The group consists mainly of the 2 rappers, but expands by 4 additional members to a hip-hop/rock live band (Empyre Village) for shows. They are often compared to a mix between “Wu Tang Clan” meets “Sublime”.
  
Dead Poets have independently released three mix-tape/albums: “The Kenny Chang Tapes” in 2008, “To The Grave” in 2009, and “The Empty Bottle Project” in 2010 all available for free download at http://www.empyrevillage.com now. The group has collaborated with artists such as “Mr Doitall” (Lords Of The Underground), Pacewon (Outsidaz), and many others.

The duo have shared the stage with acts “Wu Tang Clan”, “Red Cafe”, “Masta Ace”, “Sadat X” (Brand Nubian), “Immortal Technique”, “Jedi Mind Tricks”, “Outsidaz”, “Artifacts”, and many more.", image: "https://i0.wp.com/horrorcorewiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/dead-poets.jpg?w=305&ssl=1")

“I started this over 15 years ago, I was 13 years old, it first began with poetry. Its always been about expression for me. Its a vent to let out the emotions, A door for me to open and let my inner turmoil, thoughts and aggressions out. My mental therapy keeping me sane while I deal with the everyday struggle we call life. Everything I ever have gotten in life, I had to fight for. I would def say since I started this journey I been engulfed and overwhelmed on the bottom crawling toward this Goal. I Tried to stay focused on my dream while in the trenches battling my demons and everyone else's, My loved ones dying, the ones I love around me betraying me the whole way, putting everything I have into something and watching it fall apart and burn because people lack the honor and loyalty I give. How can a pure soul not become Dirty in this world? I don't understand it yet, but I have faith and its got me this far. I cant count the times I lost it all (Financially, Spiritually, Mentally) and had to rebuild from nothing . Its stained my soul and my flesh Ill never be the same so I accept the dirt and the struggle, and embraced it having faith I can use this to help others overcome the battle and myself, because its all I know….. This new album reflects that in every aspect from the artwork to the content on every song.

Artist.create!(name: "Dirty Crowley", bio: "Dirty Crowley is an American hip hop artist originally from Utah, now residing in Littleton Colorado. Dirty derives from the lifelong nickname Dirty (his real name being Dustin). He added Crowley onto the end to set himself apart from the many other rappers named Dirty. It was adopted from Aleister Crowley (considered one of the most evil people ever) and with his style of Hardcore Hip Hop known as Horrorcore he transformed the name “Dirty Crowley.”

Dirty Crowley was into Gangsta Rap growing up and listened to Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, 2Pac, and Coolio. At the age of 13, his friend showed him ICP and he fell in love with all the crazy lyrics that he heard on their albums. The style being so different than anything else at that time, he started exploring other artists who were starting to do similar things with their music and it grew from there.

His first live performance was back in 2006. He and his friends set up a PA several times at a park pavilion and spit offensive lyrics until someone was offended enough to call the police and shut it down. He had his first real show opening for King Gordy and then took a break from performing to start putting his albums together.

In August of 2015, he released his first EP, Poisonous Noise, with features from GrewSum, Insane Poetry, Trips, Labratz, Dr. EDrum, and Slyzwicked. From July 2014 to July 2015 he spent a year as co-president of World Wide Wicked Shit Incorporated and then in October 2015 he signed to the label, Ash of The Phoenix Productions. In November 2015, he signed with his manager Mary Warren of Xtreme Management LLC.

Growing up in the hardcore/metal scene of New England in the early 2000s, this was not his first venture musically. He had fronted a few metalcore bands, but none of the members seemed to have the same drive, ambition, and lust for music as him.

Stepping away from music for awhile, DOWNWXLF was completely blown away when he saw the music video for Paris by the $uicideboy$. It reignited his hunger for music. Artists such as Rozz Dyliams, Ghostemane, Wavy Jones, and Ouija Macc add to the list of those who inspired him to finally stop dreaming and get to creating.
  
Heavily influenced by bands from his youth, their genres ranging from numetal to deathcore, DOWNWXLF is just trying to make his own sound and inspire others in the process. His themes center around people not being themselves (whether it's out of fear or otherwise), not promoting drug culture, and his life experiences. All with horror elements sprinkled in. He has been labeled “positively dark” by one engineer and his music called “lumbertrap” by a fellow artist, Madnes_One.
  
DOWNWXLF belongs to one small collective, F0URH0RNS, that he and fellow artist/friend BXTCHWRXSTS started in October 2019 calling it D3M80YZ at the time.

Originally wanting to be in a punk rock band when he was a teenager, (That dream came true later in life as a studio band project with Steve Sxaks & Ethan Mintz Of Marsten House Recordings Called Damn Dirty Commies) but it translated into rap when he was about 18. Without any professional studio equipment at first. But that didn't matter, his need to be heard endured.

He went by many different names before landing on DRACO, Including: The Unabomber, Draco The Unabomber and probably like 10 other ones he forgot about, (or tries to forget about)

His musical influences are:
DMX, Wu Tang Clan, The Misfits, and Twiztid. And growing up un the golden age of the Philly Punk Rock Scene (Early 2000's).
And local Horrorcore and Hip Hop Artists. Some other notable influences are the Gothic and Industrial acts that would feature at local events.

His personal influences are struggles with mental illness, and a drifting outsider perspective, which both play a role in the darker nature of his work. But in contrast to those darker elements, his Judaism, being around Anti-Fascist Activists, and the afroqueer community has given DRACO a uniquely balanced personal perspective.

With over a decade in the music industry whether it's performing music, DJing for several horrorcore/underground rap radio stations (WICKED INTENT RADIO, TKSRADIO, UTMRADIO) or writing articles for several media outlets (MortalGore, OOGEEWOOGEE, Oy Gevault!, etc.) DRACO has become an undeniable fixture in the Hardcore Hip Hop and Horrorcore Rap Scene. Last but not least, in 2021, DRACO started his own music publishing and media company called Grey6 Media, a co-label to Marsten House Records that distributes through Sony/The Orchard.", image: "https://i0.wp.com/horrorcorewiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/draco.jpg?w=640&ssl=1")

In 2005 Dean was going by the alias 2 face in a group called South East Devastation. The group was made up of Dennis “Ova dose” Wolff and himself. The group started throwing house parties in the Orlando area and quickly outgrew it with attendances well into the 60s and 70s. From there they played countless local shows in the area as well as opened for national headliners, as well as being the last group to ever play the Bomb House at the Gathering of the Juggalos.

After the two parted ways with 2 albums out. Dean partnered in creating a more “southern gangster” group with his friend Stephen “Juggernaut” Mccown called Villianaires. The group continued to grow their fan base in the area. They did two albums and decided to part ways while Stephen continued in another group “Bangerzilla.”

Dean decided to take the 2face brand solo. In the coming years he would Join Blood and Guts Records of Tampa which featured owners Hater Marc, D Murder Outbreak, Thirteen among many others. Later joining the lable would be Mizt3r Purple, Miss Kisa, Stranger Haze. They would do shows all over the country, including national tours with Miss Kisa, Psycho Jesus, Mars, Boondox and more. Countless performances at the Gathering of the Juggalos including a BNG takeover of Club Chaos.

The rich history and never ending shows and adventures dwindled down over the years as everyone grew up, went to prison, started families and moved on, leaving 2face not knowing where to go.

After his mothers death Dean created the fictional town of Autumndale and focused on his first 3 graphic novels and 2 full length films.
In 2018 music called again but having left the life of drug and alcohol use behind, he needed to re-brand. Thus was born Destiny Everything and Nothing.

At the time heavily influenced by greats like 2pac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G, N.W.A, LL cool J, Run DMC, Snoop Dogg and more. Using music as a coping mechanism to overcome early signs of depression and anxiety he used music asa n outlet to escape his surroundings.

After run ins with local law enforcement he was forced to grow up quick and find a different way to express his anger and emotions. In his late teenage years he began to write and record his own material touching on life events and things that he had seen and been through, just the everyday struggle. After high school he was involved in the local music scent but never really took music seriously, it was just something to be a part of and a way to cope with hiss issues. After the tragic passing of his son in October 2005 he began to take music more seriously and really decided to pursue music fully. But along the way there were several roadblocks and obstacles in the way that derailed his progress drastically. After releasing several projects between 2008-2014 the end seemed to be creeping up fast.

After taking several years off and deciding to give up on his dreams one more giant push. In the winter of 2017 he made his return to the music scene with his album Verbal Disease. He decided to give everything he had to his music and never look back. With this new grind or die mindset he began to make noise and become noticed in the underground scene.

He began really solidifying his name and brand in the underground. Named the Voice of The Misfits by his peers he began speaking to the masses with that dark and rugged style all of his own. In 2020 while the world was in a crisis he linked back up with long time family Devil Boy aka Wicked Wayz who was fresh out the system and ready to leave his mark on the world.

Artist.create!(name: "Fat Killahz", bio: "Prepare yourself, the “World Famous” Fat Killahz have arrived! Hailing from the war-torn streets of Detroit, Michigan, the Killahz are made up of four imposing emcees: Fatt Father, ShimEBangO, Marvwon, and King Gordy.

All four are veterans of the same open mic and battle circuits that birthed the likes of Eminem, D12, Slum Village, and Royce da 5'9″. All four are proficient, battle-tested lyricists. All four are explosive performers with a love for the music. All four are also constantly hungry, for hip-hop as well as hamburgers.

Fatt Father (Fatts) is the leader of the group. Fatts is capable of going from personable to menacing in a matter of moments; lyrically vivid yet down to earth, his descriptive tales of the pleasure and pain of street life pull you into his world.

ShimEBangO, maybe the largest member, possesses an agile, quick-witted flow that's as colorful as the trademark throwback jerseys he wears. His unmistakable voice lends energy and inertia to every track he blesses.

Marvwon is a verbal flamethrower. His style is a flammable mixture of antagonistic street braggadocio and humorous pop culture references that's guaranteed to have you hitting that rewind button.

King Gordy is indescribable, an enigma wrapped in a scowling horn-headed visage, furiously spitting rapid-fire gothic venom, yet still capable of turning heads and opening ears with a unique and soulful brand of singing. Yes, singing.

The Fat Killahz began in 2001 as an inside joke between Marvwon and Fatt Father. The joke turned into serious business; they enlisted heavyweights ShimEBangO and King Gordy shortly thereafter. Seemingly overnight, open mic after open mic was ransacked by the four fat and furious emcees. Tearing down local spots like the Lush Lounge, the Blind Pig, Motor, St. Andrew¹s Hall and the Shelter, and the State Theater, FK rapidly gained respect in the streets and a devoted following. Battle opponents and fellow emcees quickly learned that FK was nothing to play with; all four emcees were skilled lyricists and engaging performers, and as a group they gradually developed a unique sound: heavy, thumping street anthems, melodic, bouncy tracks to ride to, humorous hood stories, and healthy doses of comic relief. After smashing a number of venues (including a raucous, shirtless performance at the 2002 Impact Convention,) the Killahz decided it was time to hit the studio.

They released the 2 Fat, 2 Furious mixtape to positive reactions throughout Detroit city, and the public just wanted more. Making an appearance on King Gordy¹s solo album The Entity, the single Fat-Tastic 4 rose to #1 on the college hip-hop charts. Fans still weren't satisfied. FK followed up a successful run supporting Gordy as the opening act on D12's US tour in 2004 with the release of their WFKR 31.3 FKM mixtape.

They were finally treated to the full-length they had been waiting for: on March 15th, 2005, Guess Who's Coming To Dinner? was released. Featuring production from hard hitters such as Denaun Porter (D-12, 50 Cent, Young Buck) and B.R. Gunna (Slum Village), Guess Who's Coming To Dinner? displays the Fat Killahz dynamic song writing, vivid street savvy lyrical poetry, and comedic wit. With a distribution plan in place, hip-hop heads across the country better prepare themselves to deal with the world's largest group. Fatt Killahz are currently working on their sophomore album titled Fat Tuesday.", image: "https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/ar0/51c7885964354b63b64d7fa1d9275340.jpg")

Vyce became a member around 2009 and the musical quality started to improve. He rapped and mixed most of the songs from 2010 on.

Around that time, Vyce and J Sawedoff started a side project called Cult Status, that released four EPs from 2010-2014. The third Cult Status EP featured God of Fertility as a member, and the fourth EP featured Frostbite as a member. 90% of the production on these albums was done by Vyce.

J Sawedoff was also B-Cide's hypeman for a brief period of time in 2009-10.

Initially they did not wear masks; The masks started to come into play in late 2009, and then in 2012 they picked up the luchadore masks and gained new stage personas with them.

Flesruoy Llik has had an insane amount of lineup changes and collaborators that have come and gone and sometimes came back again, but the core of the group was always the two Jeremys, and Joey Martian (Vyce/Gloom Rap).

Live shows have been very violent with self-harm and members causing harm to each other (staple guns, kendo sticks, steel chairs, body slams on thumb tacks) and sometimes even using the weapons on willing participants of the crowd.

Beginning his music career in 2002, F.E.T.U.S has crafted a new breed of music that combines Eastcoast flavor and instrumental with Southern influence and Midwest rhyme schemes to keep each verse, and ultimately song, fresh and new feeling. Calling his fans “Abortions,” the Florida native represents a darker and less often seen side of music; a style that has never been given life previously.

Earlier albums such as “Every City's A Columbine” and “Abortion Theory” showcase an anxious side of the artist, with a general theme of urgency that most believe translates to a thirst for fame and musical acceptance that has been unquenched. Later albums like 2010's “Deceptikonz” with fellow artist ClaAs show a more laid back acceptance of the music business, from the eyes of a more mature F.E.T.U.S.

In 2011, F DOT and recording group “Akvon” with Psycho Jesus and Lyrikal teamed up with Mad Insanity founder Mars to bring the Gospel Of The Grave Tour to a nationwide audience. Gaining steam from all states involved lead to an electrifying performance at The Gathering of the Juggalos in August of 2011; an annual event hosted by the Insane Clown Posse that has included performances by Tech N9ne, Ice Cube, Busta Rhymes, Mushroomhead, and Bone Thugs N Harmony.

In 2008, Dux kicked doors down when he was asked to be on the “Tunnel Runners” CD, a Hatchet House release. With the song “Die 2nite,” Dux contributed an official banger to the project which made its way to the “Top 25 Rap Albums” on the Billboard charts.

In 2009, Dux released an album with Maniac, a South Dakota MC , whose rhymes were very similiar to his.With Maniac also producing all the tracks on the LP, Dux laid all the hooks to this masterpiece that would then be called “Daywalkers: Dead by Dawn”. This 19 track disc has sold close to 2,000 copies in the Midwest and Southeast alone.

Dux's most recent release “Welcome to Granville” shows his diverse style, from street anthems like “In My Town” Feat Jelly Roll (Wyte Music/Hypnotized Minds) and bangers like “S.U.S” which shows Dux lyrical & metaphorical flows. WTG is Dux 3rd project and is his best work to this day.

Born Jaron Johnson in Richmond, California, the Bay Area MC adopted his stage moniker from a childhood nickname, Geronimo, and was influenced as much by Wu-Tang as he was Dragon Ball Z, slasher flicks, and Mortal Kombat. With a style that combined Twiztid, Esham, and early-era Eminem, G-Mo debuted with Hopsin on the track “Shit Bowl” in 2010. He released his own mixtape, Got Filth, in 2011, and its sequel, Got Filth: The Great Adventures of G-Mo, in 2012. The Android FiLFTEEN EP arrived in 2015, produced by C-Lance, the Massachusetts-born in-house producer for Jedi Mind Tricks.

G-Mo signed with Majik Ninja Entertainment and issued My Filthy Spirit Bomb in late 2016. The album debuted in the Billboard 200 and broke into the Top Five of the rap chart.

Hopsin, who dropped out earlier that year, was sent to Los Angeles County Jail where he spent a year. Upon his release in 2005 he began to pursue a career in music, purchased a microphone, and installed FL Studio (known as FruityLoops at the time) on his computer. He credits Eminem as the rapper that initially got him interested in hip hop music.

In 2007, he was signed to Ruthless Records, and had founded his own record label, Funk Volume, in 2009. He would then go on to found another record label, Undercover Prodigy, in 2016.

The original lineup reunited in 2013 and currently perform together at times under the HOK moniker. They released a box set and new music in 2018.

Hektic and Mr. Bones left the group in 1996 to form Twiztid, changing their stage names respectively to Monoxide and Jamie Madrox, which put the group on a temporary hiatus. In 1997, The R.O.C. resurrected House of Krazees, changed his stage name to Sol, and continued to perform under the House of Krazees name (for one album, to fulfill contractual obligations for one more H.O.K. album) with rapper Skrapz (formerly of 2 Krazy Devils with Psycho C). This new edition of House of Krazees released one album in 1999, “The Night They Kame Home,” and the House of Krazees name was retired by the fall of 1999. Sol and Skrapz left their old manager “Uncle Kreepy”, and formed the duo HaLFBrEEd, releasing the majority of their material on their own record label, Virus Independent.

HaLFBrEEd was active up until 2003, after only four years of activity. In 2013, it was rumored and semi-announced that HaLFBrEEd was reuniting after a decade apart. Similarly, it was rumored around this time that House of Krazees were reuniting as well with the original lineup of Sol (who later changed his name back to The R.O.C.), Jamie Madrox, and Monoxide. However, nothing came of these rumors, despite another House of Krazees compilation album being released in 2013, “Casket Cutz”, which was sold through Twiztid's online store.", image: "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/thumb/vrwrss1503812097.jpg")

Artist.create!(name: "Intrinzik", bio: "Intrinzik, born Scott Glass (Will), is an American rap artist from Phoenix, Arizona. He spent several years fronting the rap/metal trio known as Fallguy before starting his solo career. Through touring with Psychopathic Record's Twiztid and doing shows with Strange Music's Tech N9ne and other underground rap artists in the southwest region, Fallguy and Intrinzik built a loyal following of juggalos as well as underground rap and metal followers. Intrinzik started Intrinz INK Records in 2002 to release Fallguy's debut album, “Trapped Inside.”

Intrinzik started his music career behind the drum kit and as primary songwriter for punk/metal bands such as Washington DC based Unabomer and Phoenix based Dickie Staboner.

Intrinzik and long time collaborator Joe Dank then started the band Fallguy in 2001. Starting out as a 5 piece hardcore rap group, the band was forced to run all of its rhythm tracks on DAT as they were offered the opening slot on Twiztid's “Mirror Mirror” tour with limited resources. The handful of dates the band performed on quickly gained them a cult following as fans began showing up wearing ski masks, Intrinzik's trademarked disguise. The now 3 piece band went on to penetrate the underground rap market with the release of their 2003 self titled EP which contained the memorable anthem “Getchyoskimaskon.”

Fallguy continued to do shows in the southwest including the South By Southwest festival in both 2002 and 2003 opening up showcases featuring Mushroomhead, Anybody Killa, and Zug Izland. The band disassembled in 2004 shortly after the release of their biggest release to date entitled “Apocalypse 6T7″ that gained the band a distribution in Japan via RB-Records.com. The number 67 was used by fans to call out the letters F and G. Lead guitarist Driver Williams went on to join country music star Eric Church's band and rhythm player Joe Dank moved to Chicago, IL to work in marketing for a Randall Amplifiers.

Intrinzik continued his solo career performing live with Bionic Jive front man Emerg McVay and quickly released Emerg's “Slave Music: Post 911 Lyricism” on Intrinz INK as well as his own solo debut “Double U I Double L in 2004.” Intrinzik, Emerg, Ako Mack (Bionic Jive), McNastee, Menacide, Jason Porter and Slim then teamed up for a horrorcore super group Seperated at Birth and released “Nothing Like You” in both US and Japan in 2005 on Intrinz INK/RB-Records.

INT then started touring as a solo artist with Arizona based Phunk Junkeez and collaborating with Cappadonna of WU Tang Clan, Phunk Junkeez, McNastee and more to create his 2005 sophomore solo release “Tricks of the Trade.” TOTT was released both in USA and Japan and solidified Intrinzik as a solo artist.

Intrinzik then released McNastee's underground classic “Pieces of a Broken” man in 2006 on Intrinz INK as the two would continue to perform in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Utah, Colorado, and Arizona markets.

Later in 2006, Intrinzik then released a 5 year retrospective CD/DVD entitled “My Favorite Album.” This release marked Intrinzik's first fully licensed release in Japan. The album contains some of Proof of D12s final video footage and recorded material on the songs “Dead or Alive” and “My Favorite Song.” The CD also contained features from Big B (Suburban Noize), Phunk Junkeez, Cappadonna, Dirtball (Suburban Noize) and more.

Intrinzik then teamed up with Arizona based emcee Virus and released the maxi single for “Area Code” in 2007. The duo would go on to support the “Bad Mental Health” United States tour that summer with Axe Murder Boyz and Grave Plott. Intrinzik and Virus would then go on to dominate the Arizona underground by opening consistently for Tech N9ne, Andre Nickatina, Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid and most of the underground shows in the Phoenix and Tucson markets.

In 2008 Intrinzik's song “the Calvary” was featured on Hatchet House's 13 track compliation “Tunnel Runners” which debuted on the Billboard Rap Charts at #21 in the summer of 2008. 2008 also birthed Intrinzik's uber successful CD compilation series, “Underground Hustlin.”

Intrinzik then relived the Fallguy era by released “Fallguy: Resurreciton” in 2008. The album recreated the Fallguy sound using producer/engineer Larry Elyea to perform the majority of the live instrumentation. The CD features collaborations with Axe Murder Boyz, Jason Cruz of Strung Out, Proof of D12, Big B and many of Intrinzik's label mates.", image: "https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/ar0/3fdc9a63239d45a79fc6e2e5f3bbc579.jpg")

Artist.create!(name: "Jack WD", bio: "Jack Aquino, known primarily as Jack WD, was born in Lakewood, NJ on October 5, 1997.

His rap name is a combination of his real life first name and the WD as an abbreviation for “Wrestling Drummer”. In his school days, he contributing to the wrestling team where he was a co-captain his senior year and the band program as lead drummer/percussionist. He is often known as “TheWrestlingDrummer” he went to high school and even after graduating high school at 2016, he kept the name as symbolism to not forget where he came from and what built him to be the person he is.

Jack WD is often a shy and quiet person until he steps into the mic to offer a plethora of different sounds (such as trap metal, rap metal, horrorcore, speed rap and more) mixed with aggressive delivery. Jack WD has touched multiple song topics such as words of determination, violent acts, depression, and more. Overall, Jack WD considers himself as a “Whatever I Want To Make” artist and barely possesses any interest of aligning himself to a particular genre.

Most of all, he is most prominent in the underground New Jersey scene for wearing the phantom mask. The phantom mask's main purpose is to not to be used as imagery, but Jack WD claims that the mask gives him “superpowers” by turning him into a more charismatic stage personality.

Jack does not always portray as Jack WD. He also possesses an alter ego known as “10-1 C0D3K33P3R” who is a much more brutal version of Jack WD. 10-1 C0D3K33P3R was created to allow Jack to rap about topics such as describing horrific murder, death, bodily harm towards others and pent-up rage. Jack WD has portrayed as 10-1 C0D3K33P3R since 2020 despite a couple of early SoundCloud songs being the early stages of the persona. He continues to portray as 10-1 C0D3K33P3R every October ever since.

Artist.create!(name: "Jade The Nightmare", bio: "Based out of the small neighborhood, Montbello, residing in Denver,Colorado, Jade The Nightmare remains one of the most original female artist in the surrounding area. Her sound pulls influence from the king of shock rock known as Marilyn Manson and content influence from the late great Tupac Shakur and many others.

Possessing her first microphone at the young age of 11 given to her by her father. Jade was ecstatic to write her raps first consisting of just her life as a young female artist living in a middle class African-American family in the 303. Jade's music took an enormous turn in her later years when her father soon passed away without warning. This took a toll on her mindset and began to reflect signs of sadness and confusion in her music. Music and family were the only things that fill the void in Jade's soul. To worsen her situation, she underwent another death in the family the following year after her father's passing. A sense of numbness grew within her, but the one tool she used as a hobby now became an outlet to escape her conjured demons.

Jade began to develop her signature sound self-titled as “GothHop,” which is the genre she used to describe most of her music. Her music puts a dark Gothic vibe on the hardships some undergo in their life span, discussing sensitive topics such as rape, murder, poverty, depression, racism and many more. Jade's take on music has grown into something beyond just a black girl writing raps in her mothers house.

Jade is in the early stages of her company “Death Delight Creations Inc.” as well as her independently owned record label “GothHop Empire Ent.” She has accomplished a lot before even hitting 20 years old, as of 2018.

His songwriting is smart, complex, and offers a strong positive message while at the same time reminding us of the real world we live in and how we can help change it for the better. He belts out songs of love and respect, real life struggles, and evolving as a race, as we stand up against oppression and hate in all forms. His songs are personal, deep, and straight from the heart, “angry feel good music.”

Justinsayne N8V raps in many styles and also sings. He can bust out harmonies, as well as attack metal screams and swoon with a deep soulful smooth growl. He also gained a fast reputation for being a beast on stage and and tearing up live shows.

His follow up album, “WAGON BURNER,” proved his talent was not limited to just one good album. It was a beautiful continuation of the brutal in-your-face headbangers mixed with melodic, dark overtones. His songwriting skills, again, are exceptional and thought provoking, backed by amazing music production, plenty of catchy heavy guitar riffs, 808 bass, and turntable scratch action, headbangers and and dance grooves.

This Native American underground artist resides in the Northwest, was born and raised in Denver and all over the west. An ojibwe 7th fire warrior of the bear clan, from white earth reservation in Minnesota, he stays true to his roots and traditional ways, always sending positive and informative messages through his music.

Justinsayne N8V has six national tours under his belt, touring with some of the biggest names in independent music, as well as performing at huge national festivals and building his home base of justinsayniacs in his home state of Oregon.

He has been featured in over 40 collaboration songs with other artists and a familiar face in the underground hustler series of mixtapes. He has been nominated for numerous awards and Wagon Burner was named one of the 10 best albums of 2014 in Oregon.

Since the release of his second album, he has toured and rocked stages across the nation non stop, building steam and gaining fans, releasing videos and new singles regularly to keep his justinsayniacs appeased.

He has just finished his third album entitled “BORDERLINE PERSONALITY,” which promises to be another amazing journey through the heart, mind, and voice of the man that brings that native thunda.

His first horror film was The Exorcist at the young age of three. Since then he was never the same, always going to his local VHS rental store to pick up stuff like ZOMBIE, DAWN OF THE DEAD, THE BEYOND, FACES OF DEATH 1-6, and other sicko films while picking up the usual ROBOTECH episodes or TRANSFORMERS tapes. He became the biggest horror fan in his early years.

At 14 he started to try to find a identity that gave a glimpse into who he was in his mind, and after a few years of writing and getting his feet wet into recording tracks, he started work on his first Ep, THE SEVEN DOORZ TO DEATH, a seven song album inspired by his relationship with life at the time. He is a Gemini, which is why he prefers to be two different identities, a schizophrenic in the musical world he created from his depraved mind. J.Hexx, the first of the two is the evil in man that wants to express his hatred for life and the challenges it presents.

Joe Blakk, is his positive side, who daily has conflicts with J.Hexx in order to maintain his sanity. Both together form THE J.HEXX PROJECT.

Artist.create!(name: "KannibalistiK", bio: "Hailing from Windsor, Ontario, KannibalistiK crashed on to the local underground scene in 2001 with it's independent release “Blood Thirsty”. The album was well received in the Windsor/Detroit area creating strong local support and gave birth to the now classic tracks “God is Dead” and “Through My Eyes”. With the growing popularity of the internet and digital media, “Blood Thirsty” quickly infected and spread over seas, gaining fans all over Europe and the eastern side of the world. In 2002 KannibalistiK was awarded the 91.5FM CJAM award for best new local talent thanks to late night radio air play on the now defunct Psychopathic Hour radio show.

The promotional run for the album lasted two years and saw the release of two newer singles during that period, “H.A.T.E”, which was released as an online single and “Satanic Poetry” which was released on the “Formation of The Cult” compilation album. During this period KannibalistiK also worked with many aritsts including Defekt, Hospital H, Fuckfase/Sedition, J Reno, Krimmy Van Skull, Bruce B and Richy Nix among others. In 2003 KannibalistiK released the single “Bleeding For Midnight” to begin promoting the new KannibalistiK album “Blasphemy: True Words of Worship”. The single received rave reviews from the underground community due to its more aggressive style and hardened sound. The track was played regularly late-night on 91.5 FM and then KannibalistiK disappeared. Keno Kain (producer, composer and front man for KannibalistiK) moved on to play guitar in various heavy metal bands and Kannibalistik found its way to the grave…

…until 2010, almost a decade a later, KannibalistiK came back and released finally his second album “Blasphemy: True Words of Worship” in 2011. Between the years 2011-2013 he appeared with some new tracks (“Kill the Mother Fucker”, “Necrogod” & “Dying in The 21st Century”) on a few horrorcore compilations like “Mortal Gore Presents: Infest Vol. 1” (2011), “Devilz Nite 2012” and “Slaughtercore Entertainment: Season of Slaughter” (2013).

Artist.create!(name: "Keepa", bio: "I'm a 35-year-old music artist from La Porte, Texas. I don't make music for anyone but myself. I hope that doesn't offend anyone, but I feel music loses all substance when there is a goal or an audience involved. I try to let my work naturally evolve during creation. Which is exactly the opposite of what happens in most of the rap industry. I hope others can enjoy my work, but its not going to kill me if that doesn't happen. The one thing I would like people to walk away with is that I'm not stereotypical and I care about what I do and the music industry as a whole. Some of my earlier works may not reflect this attitude, but now that I know what I am doing, I hope this is the sound and personality that emanates.

I began rapping in 1996 with two of my best friends in the group LP Trinity. We formed the record label Trinity 4 Infinity Records in 1998 and eventually rebranded it Terrorific Entertainment in 2000. We also had a large artist pool that we called Evil Empire. Sadly, in the middle of 2006 we all pretty much lost contact with one another. MastaMind and myself were essentialy the only one's left and in early 2008 MastaMind and I split up as well. Most of my work is rather hardcore and very opinionated. I tell it like it is and don't care what anyone thinks. It's music and people can interpret it however they like.

It was in August of 2006 when Killator and his long time friend, Grimm, founded the underground rap group Corpse Circus.

Corpse Circus was an instant hit on the now defunct website MySpace.

Killator is easily recognized by his yellow skull mask, elvis shades, beanie and gold chain.

His voice is unique due to being raised by his English mother, and his American father (from the southern states), both of whom had very heavy accents and both had what he deemed an “odd vocabulary” which was different than everyone he met in his birth state of California.

Killator has performed under many monikers, including: T.A.P.E.S., Ensomniak (of Ensom & Shaddo), Lord Krang (of TMNTK), Scorn Star of the Dirty Slutz, and Disgusting Justin (of The Manson Bros.) and more.

Killy is known for his merchandising sensibilities, paired with his artistic abilities, allowing for his band to have a very professional appearance.

Sadly, Dr. Jekyl and Lucifa' have both since passed away, leaving Titan and LeathaFace the only members left in the group.

Heavily influenced by the sound of the Geto Boys, Kinghood Cykoz really had no idea that what they were creating was borderline horrorcore/gangsta rap. Aall tracks that were ever recorded were done so at Boomin Records Studios by engineer DJ Clay of Ruff 'n Rugged. Even though their style and sound can be compared to local favorites, The Dayton Family, Kinghood's music was always a bit darker in both productions and lyrical content.

Titan Kill-a-Gram also recorded two solo albums, appeared on the “In the Company of Killers” compilation, “Deadmate” maxi-single, “Arkhitect Presents Foul Mouth Emcees” compilation.

Before his passing, Lucifa' aka $tainle$$ $teele also released the “Full Moon Over Flint” mixtape. Titan has also added bonus, unreleased tracks by Lucifa' and Flint group Hardware to the long list of about 30 total tracks that the Kinghood Cykoz have ever produced.

Artist.create!(name: "Koffin Creep", bio: "It all started back in 1999, on Shadow's birthday. His mother got him The Ringmaster CD (Insane Clown Posse). Shadow is not a Hip Hop or Rap music fan, but he new ICP were rappers, so as to not hurt his mother's feelings he listened to the CD. Listening to the music, he noticed it was not the same as other music; It was dark and wicked. He enjoyed the style ICP used since Shadow was 'Goth' and was a huge fan of the horror genre.

After listening to the CD, Shadow turned to the internet to see if there were any other artist like ICP in the music industry. That's when Shadow first discovered the term Horrorcore and found something far more darker: Murder House Records, Serial Killin' Records (SKR), and Mad Insanity. Since that day, Shadow began to study more artists with the goal of understanding the Horrorcore genre and fell in love with the Horrorcore scene.

Later on in Shadow's life, Shadow met his first 'Juggalo' friend in Middle School. Hanging out with this friend using a tape recorder and 'ripped off' beats, Shadow and his 'Juggalo' friend began to record some of Shadow's less than great work.

Starting off as the 'Joker Brothers' wearing painter caps and jester make up, they recorded their first album, The Rising Sun, which never made it past their front door. As time passed, the duo practiced continuously until the second release was made: Southwest Clownin, which was passed out at Hallowicked (an annual ICP concert held every Halloween) 2000.

A short time after, Shadow's older brother passed away. After the incident, the 'Joker Brothers' ended their musical career before it ever had the chance to take off. In 2004, Shadow met a recording artist named Axem The Serial Killa at Hallowicked 2004. After a few days had passed, Axem and Shadow got together and talked about music. This lead to Axem taking Shadow under his wing and signed him to 'Hatchet Rising Records', where Axem and Shadow released their first album entitled Dinner Time as the duo group 'Rotten Face'.

In a verse from one of the songs' titles Neva Gonna Catch Me, Axem stated “…My homie Shadow is a sick fuck and will eat yo liva like Hannibal that's why I call him Shadow The Cannibal…” and from that day on Shadow was deemed Shadow The Cannibal. However, after the release of their first album, Axem slowly faded away from the music scene to deal with life's challenges and Shadow was once again left on his own.

In mid 2005, Shadow released a free 'sampler' online entitled Gothic Freak from his MySpace account. Shadow received over 300 friend requests and more than 650 downloads in just a few days. From that day on, Shadow knew he had a chance to make his name known in the Underground music industry.

Since that day, Shadow has worked and performed with many known artists, has been featured on numerous albums, and has also released several albums on his own. In 2009, Shadow performed his first 'big' show, The Tenth Annual Gathering of The Juggalos, and at the gathering, Shadow had the opportunity to talk to one of his long time favorite performers and one of his main influences, Ikkurruz The Drunkin Pumkin. Since then, Shadow has worked with Ikkurruz on many different occasions, are close friends and Shadow even runs the Ikkurruz Street Team. Shadow The Cannibal has come a long way, his musical styling has changed for the darker and sicker, and has a strong fan base.

In mid 2010, Shadow started a side project with a different music style. Mixing his love for goth/emo/screamo and horrorcore, Koffin Creep was born.

Shadow released a track entitled Koffin Creep (on the Verbal Abuse 6 mixtape), but that was as far as the name got. In 2011, Shadow's longtime idol/inspiration and best friend Stitchez passed away. Stitchez being a well known name and “King of Horrorcore” started a small genre of horrorcore called Rape Musick. Shadow was one of artists who was part of this group of rappers who were straight up shock value raps! After Stitchez' passing, the scene changed and Shadow started to slowly move forward in music by playing less in that genre, finally saying it was time to move on due to many problems and misunderstandings.

Koffin tried to bring Shadow back one more time with the help of Andy Christ starting a group “Krypted Killaz,” which was unsuccessful due to lack of business. So Koffin's true passion will always be the Creep. Changing styles, voice, and heart growing up and becoming a better man.", image: "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b27314be1980699454d9d6231995")

In addition, KFV has collaborated with musicians such as jazz trumpeter Eddie Gale, Hopsin, Brother J of X Clan, Cougnut, Whitney Peyton and Spice 1.

Kung Fu Vampire began breakdancing at the age of six, and taught himself how to rap and sing while playing drums and bass as a hobby. At the age of 12, his aunt began taking him to see concert performances, and introduced him to a gothic style of dress. At 14 years old he and three friends formed a group infusing classic hip hop with funk and electronica. In 2001, as a late teen he adopted the name “Kung Fu Vampire” during a conversation with his friends in which they discussed the idea of a martial arts film featuring vampires. Kung Fu Vampire formed a band, and he also used the vampire concept to write a novel (unpublished). He describes the sense of balance as the “Yin and Yang of Fang.”

In 2006, the group was voted the best local band by Metro Silicon Valley readers. Director Darren Lynn Bousman was impressed by Kung Fu Vampire's performance style, and pushed for the rapper to perform at the release party for Saw III as well as opting to do a music video. Kung Fu Vampire has also performed at The Playboy Mansion. Bousman's association with Kung Fu Vampire continued with performances at the release party for Repo! The Genetic Opera, and Bousman included Kung Fu Vampire's song “Dead Girls Don't Say No” in the film Mother's Day. In 2009, Faygoluvers featured Kung Fu Vampire's music video “iCount” on the site, attracting the attention of Twiztid, who invited Kung Fu Vampire to perform as the duo's opening act during their 2010 “Slaughterhouse” tour. Since 2010, KFV has done 13 tours including 2 in Canada and 4 appearances at the Gathering of the Juggalos in Cave-In-Rock, Illinois, and Thornton, Ohio. Kung Fu Vampire has not signed to a major label, and remains an independent artist. In 2012, Kung Fu Vampire appeared in the music video for E-40's song “Zombie” featuring Brotha Lynch Hung and Tech N9ne. In 2013, Kung Fu Vampire appeared on the reality show Oddities: San Francisco on the History and Science Channel. In late 2015 KFV released a music video, “Slice Of Life”.

Artist.create!(name: "Leticia Gore", bio: "Leticia Gore began her rap endeavor as Kilo Crackroxxx in 2008, with a few local artists just starting out in the scene in Omaha, Nebraska. Her lyrics and subject matter began to focus on more horror-themed and darker subject matter than her associates, as these topics had always been of fascination to her. And so she delved into the genre known as horrorcore, spewing morbid tales of death, destruction, insanity and murder. She intermingles these subjects with displays of feminine playfulness and sexual wiles to seduce the listener into a realm they were not aware they would be getting into, giving Kilo a unique approach and representation of terror in disguise. In 2009, she began working closely with local horrorcore legend, Komatose, and solidified a place in the venture into horrorcore, releasing her first full length album, “Eat Your Heart Out” in 2010, an EP, “State of Withdrawal” (2011), and a second LP, “Erotic Nightmarez” (2012).

In 2013, gaining a small following, she began to take her music more seriously and Kilo Crackroxxx began using the name ‘Leticia Gore’, a more fitting moniker for the genre. After this transformation of sorts, she released two more full length solo albums; “Memento Mori” (2013) and “Lipstick & Lobotomies” (2014) another EP, “Girls Just Want Your Blood” (2013), and released a collaborative group album with Komatose, “Oktoberz Children” (2013). She has been featured by many other artists inside and outside the genre of horrorcore on various projects. Her journey thus far has proved to show her growth as an artist, lyricist and story-teller, with no signs of slowing down.

Artist.create!(name: "Lil Ninja", bio: "Lil Ninja (Damion Brooks) was born in a small town in Western Michigan, United States in 2009. He lived a normal life until, at age 6 in 2015 he was introduced to horrorcore by his dad. His dad handed him a CD copy of Insane Clown Posse’s album Hell’s Pit. Once Lil Ninja heard it, BLAM, he was a juggalo from then on. He loved this album and as he listened more and more, he got introduced to the album The Marvelous Missing Link:Lost by Insane Clown Posse. Yet again, he loved it. By age 8, he forgot all about ICP due to him not being able to have their music at his fingertips.

In 2017, the juggalo gods gave him the song Piggy Pie reintroducing him to ICP. Now he begins research. He finds more artists, such as Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Twiztid, Dark Lotus, and the rest of the Psychopathic Records roster. Then in 2019 he stumbled into the Juggalo YouTube (YJC AKA Juggalo YouTube Community). He found all these people such as DC Faygo Guy, Carnival Spirits, and many more.

During all of the juggalo research, he faced a massive loss — In 2020, Lil Ninja’s house burned to the ground. With no where to go, he begins to turn to juggalo music. He stayed with someone for a good few months. In that time period, he started a YouTube career; He called his channel “Taco Demon.” After all the failures, he was focused on one thing — JUGGALOS.

In 2021, he decided to rename himself Lil Ninja. He uploaded reviews for ICP’s Carnival of Carnage and The Ringmaster. Right then, he was noticed by a friend of Scottie D, the infamous founder of FaygoLuvers.net. Their name was Milinda Villegas and they told Scottie D about him. At the time, he only had a few Juggalo CDs, so a group of Scottie D’s friends put together a box full of juggalo merchandise for Lil Ninja. When he got this box, his videos began to blow up.

Lil Ninja has come a long way since, by gaining attention by DC Faygo Guy, Humble Among, Bartleboss and the dead guy show, Faygo Luvers Heaven, Don Chaos, Deck One Dealt, Open Hearted Juggalos Recovery And Support, and more, within 2022. Humble Among did an interview with Lil Ninja, and shortly after that he was on Deck One Dealt – Juggalo Podcast. After that ,he gained friends with lots of new homies like Komplex Mothra, Nobody Man, Humble Among, Raziel, Woody Woo, and more. At school he had some good homies to roll with like his best friends Camdyn, Jenna (Jacx), Aniya, and Kaleb.

Now, in June of 2022, Lil Ninja drew inspiration from a handful of artists such as Humble Among, Komplex Mothra, Insane Clown Posse, Ouija Macc, and Mike E Clark. He began advertising an album called “Beats From The Grave.” It came out on July 2nd Of 2022 and it had a deep concept of a man who tried to raise the dead with his friends who ends up getting murdered by a demon when he digs up the grave. His friends warned him, but he did not listen. Now, as he dies, he goes into hell and when you hear a beat coming from the grave, that is the man trying to escape hell. Adding to that concept with The Monster EP, released in August of 2022. It added on being the fact that the man arises from the dirt as a mutated monster and roams the streets with beats.

To hold off until The Aftermath album comes out, Lil Ninja is making a mixtape called the Rotting mixtape. On October 19th, The Aftermath Side A will be released, and in December, Side B will be out. Then some massive plans and some side albums will be coming out… You’ve been warned.", image: "https://i0.wp.com/horrorcorewiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/lil-ninja.jpg?w=423&ssl=1")

Artist.create!(name: "Lord Infamous", bio: "Ricky T. Dunigan (November 17, 1973 – December 20, 2013), better known by his stage name Lord Infamous, was an American rapper from Memphis, Tennessee.

He was a co-founder of Three 6 Mafia and the older half-brother of DJ Paul. His lyrics touched on macabre subjects such as Satanism, mass murder, and torture, along with themes such as crime and drugs.

Lord Infamous started his music career in the early 1990s with his half-brother DJ Paul. They were fairly popular in the south Memphis area and released self-recorded tapes in their neighborhood, school, and local shops. Their first known tape entitled Portrait of a Serial Killa, was released in 1992.

In 1991 Lord Infamous and DJ Paul met up with fellow north Memphis rapper and producer Juicy J. These three along with a few other local rappers formed a group initially called “The Backyard Posse”, which later went on to be known as “Triple 6 Mafia”. The first record deal for the group was with Nick Scarfo and Prophet Posse. Under the label they released their first underground album, Smoked Out, Loced Out in 1994. At the same time, Lord Infamous released his first underground solo album, Lord of Terror. Shortly after in 1995, the group changed its name to Three 6 Mafia and released their debut album, Mystic Stylez. At this time Three 6 Mafia members DJ Paul and Juicy J were creating their own record company, Hypnotize Minds, which Lord Infamous became a part of. The group went on to release 4 more mainstream albums and numerous solo projects through the mid-2000s, though during this time the group became smaller due to the departure of several artists for various reasons.

In 2006, following jail time which led to a breach of contract with Sony, Lord Infamous was forced to end work with Three 6 Mafia, leaving the group on good terms. Lord Infamous later reunited with DJ Paul for Paul’s 2009 solo album, Scale-A-Ton. This marked the first time they had worked together since Three 6 Mafia’s 2005 album Choices II: The Setup.

Soon after his departure from Three 6 Mafia, Lord Infamous and long time friend and Memphis rapper II Tone formed a new record company, “Black Rain Entertainment”. Shortly thereafter Memphis rapper Mac Montese and Atlanta rapper T-Rock became involved with the company, forming what is now known as “The Club House Click”. They went on to release several group albums, solo albums and EPs, including several solo albums from Lord Infamous – The Man, The Myth, The Legacy in 2007, Futuristic Rowdy Bounty Hunter in 2010, Scarecrow Tha Terrible in 2011, Legendary Hits, King Of Horrorcore and Back From Tha Dead (Deadly Proverbs) in 2012.

Artist.create!(name: "Madd Maxxx", bio: "There are artists who come along every so often who don’t make any sense but click at the same time. Rappers come and go by the dozen in today’s age, with mp3’s and smartphones replacing CD’s and the Walkman things are much different than they used to be. And didn’t CD’s replace cassettes before that? But amidst the shifting sand that is the scene every so often you find somebody who can transcend the nonsense to just make great music. Madd Maxxx is one of those. Rough around the edges no doubt but amongst the better lyricists today, though largely unrecognized. His rhymes are direct and impactful, leaving everything and nothing to the imagination while you go for a ride that can be a leisurely stroll or a death march, sometimes all at once. His roots are in hip hop and the wicked, dark laughter and street cypher sessions combined to form tracks that don’t leave you so quickly, it’s a feeling that stays with you. Sick Hop is what he calls it, and has since 2006 at least. There are a few others who rep the terminology, but only the originals from the early days of rap can rightfully claim that style. In the underground, Madd Maxxx holds the title and awaits eagerly anyone who wants to try and claim it. There is plenty that can be said about Madd Maxxx but what’s the point? Why not just listen to something?

The history of Madd Maxxx is simple and inauspicious, except for that one thing. He isn’t special but some special incidents have led him down this path into the vocal booth and onto the stage. The reality of his origin comes back in 1999, around May, not long after Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold decided to make “school shooter” a new cultural identity. His schoolmates and their parents thought Maxxx was dangerous because he liked Marilyn Manson and ICP and other weird music like those two kids who brought shotguns to class in Colorado. so they got together to try and have him kicked out of the school a month before he was set to graduate and leave anyway. It didn’t work, but it still took Max into a dark, angry place. One day, Maxxx’s father overheard him saying how he never wanted to kill anyone until they all accused him of plotting to kill them. He knew Max was listening to rap music but newer and different rap that didn’t sound like the old Beastie Boys and Nas tracks he was familiar with. In what was either a stunning epiphany or a fleeting realization he said to Maxxx, “Why don’t you just make a song and kill them there? They can’t put you in jail for that”…….and so it began.

Madd Maxxx has released music on at least four labels to date, though no official release has ever been made until recently with his first true record to date, “Where Thx Wxld Thxngs Are”, scheduled to drop in early 2016. His most highly regarded work to this day remains “In the Absence of Sanity” which contained songs such as “F*ck Life”, “Be My Victim” and the aforementioned “Classtime Horror”. It is also the only work save for the forthcoming album recorded professionally, the rest of his work has been done on several different home set-ups and “studios”. Compilations such as the origin project “Sick Hop”, “Unearth the Underground” and more recently “Sex & Violence” showcase his ability to take a found beat and a simple setup and turn it into something powerful. No matter what the audio quality is the lyrics shine through, giving him an ability to captivate fans for more than a decade now. It is not unusual for someone to say they have been listening to Madd Maxxx since High School and they’ve just recently finished college. And his rhymes continue to flourish; with his arrival on Brix 2 Tha Stix Entertainment alongside Boston heavyweight rapper Wayne Da Payne he only further solidifies his place as one of the real contenders in the underground. He’s been lighting up stages all over New England the last 6 years, and he shows no signs of slowing. Having performed alongside acts such as Twiztid, Hed P.E., Hopsin, Swollen Members, D12 and more, Maxxx is certainly at home on stage. Where he goes from here remains to be seen, but looking at his track record one can only imagine…", image: "https://i0.wp.com/www.faygoluvers.net/v5/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MADD-MAXX.jpg?fit=596%2C600&ssl=1")

M.A.D. and Ant Dog both bring unique sounds from rock, hip-hop, rap, and horror core to their music. Some would say their sound is reminiscent to 90’s hip-hop with the stage presence of a rock band. They’ve performed all over California bringing high energy, lots of bass, and engagement no matter the size of the crowd. You can expect to see them jumping all over the stage and getting the crowd involved every time.

The group has shared the stage with artists like GZA and the Wu-Tang Clan, KRS-One, M.O.P Hopsin, Dizzy Wright, Tech N9ne, Black Rob, Kurupt, Afroman, Twisted Insane, Slain, Boondox, Twiztid, Crooked I, Whitney Payton, Joe Moses, and YG, G-MO Skee, Kung Fu Vampire, Scum and LSP, Stevie Stone, Waka Flaka, Vanilla Ice, P.O.D., R.A the Rugged Man, Afroman, Moonshine Bandits, Anybody Killa (ABK), Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Damien Quinn, Krizz Kaliko, Brotha Lynch Hung, and pretty much everyone from Strange Music. Their biggest show, with over 1,300 people, was in 2018 opening for the Wu-Tang Clan at the Novo in downtown Los Angeles. In addition, Madopelli Music has performed at the Gathering of the Juggalos 2017 & 2018, invited in 2019, and they have plans to return this year.

Madopelli Music was named by M.A.D. combining his name and Kokopelli, a Native American fertility god who was cast out of his tribe. He traveled around doing music circles in the other camps. When he left the camps, it would bring life to the dead crops and women would turn up pregnant. Madopelli is like his new-age cousin bringing life to each new city after rocking a show.

​The group is always working on upcoming shows that provides opportunities for them and the whole underground scene. They’re working to book more artists and bands from the Midwest and East Coast to come perform in SoCal.

When they’re not doing music the group looks to engage with their community through charitable causes like Toys for Tots (two years) and The Biggest Easter Egg Hunt Ever (three years) hosted by Straight Banger Productions.", image: "https://i0.wp.com/www.faygoluvers.net/v5/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/madopelli_lsp.jpg?fit=506%2C600&ssl=1")

Artist.create!(name: "McNastee", bio: "Rapper, producer, engineer, creative director, and label owner sounds more like a small office, much less one person alone, but this may be the easiest way to condense the talents of the multifaceted McNastee in one sentence.

Born Christopher McDaniel on August 23, 1978 to a military family in Germany, McNastee spent most of his childhood moving between the United States and Europe before his family settled in Lawton, Oklahoma when he was 15. Now residing in Phoenix, AZ, McNastee continues to introduce new fans to his music released by Intrinz Ink Records while promoting the Underground Hustlin’ brand and his own company, Thirteen Percent.

McNastee began his musical journey as the frontman for the Doozers, a street punk foursome that played together from 1998 to 2001. The group toured the midwest for a short period of time opening for notable acts like The Queers, One-Man-Army, The Business, and Hudson Falcons. They also recorded a full length record “Blood, Sweat, and Beers” with Flaming Lips guitar-tech Trent Bell at Bell Labs, in Norman, OK.

McNastee found a place in hip-hop by entering a song-writing contest conducted by Detroit producer Mike E. Clark (Insane Clown Posse, Kid Rock, George Clinton). His third place finish found him with an instant internet fanbase and he quickly recorded two albums of crudely recorded material which became Delusions of Grandeur and Triskaidekaphobia.

In 2002, McNastee found himself on the mainstage of Psychopathic Record’s annual Gathering of the Juggalos competing against Michigan rap acts V-Sinizter and Rottin for an EP recording contract. McNastee finished as a runner-up to eventual winner V-Sinizter but was awarded the opportunity to record with then Twiztid producer Fritz the Cat at, Psychopathic Records recording studio, The Lotus Pod.

During his trip to Detroit McNastee not only recording with Fritz but also collaborated with Mike E. Clark on a track called “I’m Wrong.”

McNastee’s career began to move forward at a much faster pace in 2004 when he released multiple projects including Heavy Hittaz: Spring Training with long-time collaborator and Thirteen Percent partner, Menacide. Spring Training solidified the duo’s position in the underground and was followed up by Bootleggin’ 2004, released by Massachusetts hip hop label, Delusional Records, and Menacide’s epic “Drugz LP.” McNastee’s visibility was boosted greatly through these projects which featured guest appearances by the late Proof of D12, King Gordy, Marz, Mars of Mad Insanity, Q-Strange, and more.

In 2005 McNastee collaborated with Intrinzik, Menacide, Ako Mack (Bionic Jive), Emerg McVay (Bionic Jive), Jason Porter and Slim to form Seperated at Birth. The group recorded the album “Nothing Like You” which was produced by Larry Elyea of Mind’s Eye Digital. The album received critical praise and was distributed in the U.S. by Intrinz Ink and Long Range Distro and in Japan by R-B records.

2005 also saw the release of Menacide & McNastee: From the Stix to the Six-One-Six a collection of unreleased and mixtape tracks from the Heavy Hittin’ duo. The cd was original distributed for free to fans who purchased the Down South Delivery Man mixtapes from DJ 31 Degreez that often featured McNastee tracks.

In 2006 Intrinz Ink Records released McNastee’s most personal album to date “Pieces of a Broken Man.” The album was produced almost entirely by Rockwise and to this date is a favorite among underground rap fans. The album includes collaborations with Proof of D12, Intrinzik, Menacide and more.

McNastee has since released two projects: Great Plains Drifter and the eagerly-anticipated Heavy Hittaz album, Thirteen Percent. Thirteen Percent marked the launch of the Thirteen Percent brand, a collaborative effort between himself and, Grand Rapids , MI rapper, Menacide.

Currently McNastee is working out of Phoenix, AZ recording a new album with, Kansas City producer, Matt Freix and, engineer, Aaron Connor (Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, Ruthless Records, Tech N9ne, B.G. Bulletwound) called “All the King’s Men.” He’s also actively working for and promoting UGH Artist Services, designing graphics for every UGH compilation, freelancing both art and production all while helping build Thirteen Percent and Intrinz Ink Records.", image: "https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/ar0/39ccd35fa02c4b099c09d8dfa7015ede.jpg")

Artist.create!(name: "Menacide", bio: "Menacide was a veteran of the “Gun Rule” (Grand Rapids, MI) Hip Hop scene with several credible accomplishments attached to his name. He released over a dozen albums, sat in the same studio as Eminem (while working with Proof Of D12), and paid enough real dues to cover the work ethic of a dozen indie artists combined. In 2001, his “In My World” E.P. garnered so much attention from local media, that the Associated Press picked up the story and blasted it across the national news wire. Cutting his teeth by pounding out show after show locally, he also went on to be featured on the syndicated Michigan Radio Network (MRN) for an almost unheard of nationwide promo-cast.

2003’s “Knuckle Up” LP introduced bored underground fans to a world of revised hardcore rap, while showcasing Menacide’s ability to spin new life into angry anthems. In 2005, his “Drugz” LP stole the number one selling spot at several online media outlets, and went on to become a fan-favorite with such bangers as “Braggin’ Rightz”, the proud-to-be-below-radar anthem, “Underground King”, and “Drugz” (Feat. Proof Of D12) (RIP). “I’m grateful for having had the opportunity to work with him (Proof) for the title track on that record. He lit a fire under my ass that’s been burning ever since”, he affirms. It was during this studio session in Detroit where he was invited to meet 8 Mile famed Eminem, whom he humbly acknowledges as the best thing to ever happen to the relevance of Michigan Hip Hop.

A proponent of unique self-marketing, Menacide’s releases have been attached to some rather creative promo campaigns, including a contest for buyers of his “Drugz LP”, who were entered into a drawing to win a real body bag stuffed with CD’s, posters, and other merch goodies. Following with the album’s “paraphernalia” theme, the CD came packaged in a genuine police-evidence bag, along with a bonus poster and bandanna.

In September of 2007, bundled with a full, two-hour documentary DVD entitled “Music Iz Life”, Menacide’s much-anticipated “Street Symphony” CD hit stores nationwide (via LRD/Oarfin/Koch). The album boasted an impressive lineup, including special guest appearances from Cypress Hill, Insane Poetry, and Flint, Michigan’s gold-selling The Dayton Family. His music has also been licensed for commercial DVD markets, such as “Turnagain 4” (a snow-sports series) and “New Jack Hardcore” (a brutal wrestling documentary).

Always a proud contributor to the ever-growing phenomenon known as “The Wicked Underground”, Menacide worked with some of Horrorcore’s greatest talents including Detroit’s King Gordy, Prozak and Madness (of Saginaw’s Bedlam), Q Strange, and many more. In 2006, he performed via honorary invitation at Prozak’s annual “Wickedstock” festival alongside Tech N9ne, Project: Deadman, and pioneering Detroit artist, The R.O.C. Menacide was also the creator of the internet-famed “Devil’z Nite” compilation series, which he ran consecutively for six years to help push talented artists to the forefront of the exposure pool. In 2005, he was nominated for and won the “Best Rapper” award by way of fan votes at TCN, a network within the genre.

Artist.create!(name: "Mental Ward", bio: "Mental Ward began in the early days as cWc (chemical waste children) and consisted of Mr. Stitchez amd Kontamination. They grew up in Rast Dearborn, MI and became friends early on, during elementary school through their love of wicked music. They then began recording through a karaoke tape player and made a ton of their beats on the video game “MTV Music Generator” for Playstation. During these years, they had moved around and gotten older and had met a lifelong friend who joined with them to collectively create “Mental Ward.”

The newly formed group started gaining a following by doing shows in VFW halls in Southeast Michigan and Northwest Ohio. They then came in contact with other groups such as “NDC.” The record label, Murder House Records, signed them and released “Godz Unwanted Children.” From there on, the sky was the limit. As a sub-label of MHR, “Kill Yourself Productionz” (KYP) was also created, where Mental Ward signed the group “NDC,” Demonic, and Lyssa Cer as their first label mates.

KYP and MHR would then reign supreme in the Southeast Michigan area, holding at least two shows per month in a venue that was basically their very own home. The venue itself also became a bit of a new Horror staple, too; It was known as the “Mod X” (Modern Exchange). These bi-weekly shows grew and had the likes of big names attached, pulling anywhere from 200 to 500 people on any given night.

From 2003 to 2011, Mental Ward would put out three more albums, one being a sampler and the other two, studio recordings. Things were going very well and Stitchez and just wrapped on recording a solo in New Mexico with the SKR camp. Unfortunately, it wasn’t soon after that Stitchez passed away.

The underground shook at the loss and the people closest to this tight-knit circle were lost. They continued to do as he would have wanted, with Big K dropping a solo, “The Cellar Door.”

There has been a lasting and sorrowful impact at the loss of Stitchez through the underground. As for the others related above, life is swell. While this was to be a biography about Mental Ward, in the hearts of those who were close to them, it is hard to not think of yourself as an alternate member, as they were beyond kind and welcoming in every way.", image: "https://i0.wp.com/horrorcorewiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/mental-ward.jpg?w=400&ssl=1")

Artist.create!(name: "Sepsis", bio: "Born in 1987, Sepsis has been playing guitar and doing vocals since the age of 13. Growing up listening to a diversity of music; classic rock, alternative, funk, r&b, rap, hip hop, heavy metal. He grew into expanding the diversities of music as time went on; death metal, black metal, horrorcore, grindcore, thrash, pop, techno, dance, dubstep, experimental. He picked up his first guitar learned 2-3 actual chords, but never learned how to read music and at that point was self taught and almost immediately began creating original sound. Becoming well-rounded on bass guitar, keyboard, and drums.

In 2002, he was able to begin his journey in the Metal Scene, and a year later in 2003 also began his journey in the Horrorcore Rap Scene helping co-create Sadiztik Productionz (a label which once had Smallz One, IllNickell, Razakel, and more signed). He’s been doing live performances, recordings in solo and group projects, and collaborations ever since. Past & Current groups including; Obscene S.K.S. (Smoke, Korpse, Sepsis), Eternal Sadizts (past members: IllNickell, Smallz One, Korpse, That Killa, Jake The Ripper, C3, & Dan OG), Murder Story (Korpse, Sepsis, That Killa), Sadiztik Mindz (Smoke, Korpse, Sepsis, Tine Loc, Lil Trece), S.K.R. All Stars (Serial Killin Records), Tortu-R-us (Dr. Gloom, Sepsis, Hardcore Chris, past member; Dan OG), and more…

In 2010, he re-branded The Real Sadiztik Productionz into Septicemia Records. Recruiting and signing artists such as Dr. Gloom and Genghis Khan. By then Eternal Sadizts was then re-created and added artists including; Jake The Ripper, C3, Loc On3, Joker Smurf, and later Dan OG, UpTown, & Baby Droopy . The success of Septicemia Records & Sep Promotions (w.k.a. Brilliant & Brutal Booking) began not too long thereafter. On the uprise in the underground of the Southwest United States, him and his label began opening for National & Semi-National acts. Appealing to many genre’s and crowds.

Later on 2016 and so on is when Sepsis would take himself, label mates, and other underground artists on 3 independent tours across the SW US. Continuing to thrive and work his way through every genre with his label mates by his side. In 2021 Sepsis won New Mexico Music Awards in the Rap Category with the song “2 in 1” from the album Top Shelf Life 2.

Artist.create!(name: "ShadowX", bio: "Most Horrorcore rappers stick to a classic tradition that has gotten old quickly. The genre seems to currently be lacking a lot of substance, and it seems that it’s been going downhill for a long time. A lot of artists use the same formula, of chop this, hack that, murder murder murder, gore gore gore, and leave it at that. They don’t have any talent to account for, other than being able to kind-of rap in general, and being edgy while doing so. There are a few gems amongst the others of course, artists who go the extra mile with their creativity and craft. Artists who use top-notch lyricism, original ideas, and who make music for the passion of making it.

I, ShadowX, promise to deliver in those categories. From gut-wrenching wordplay to the crazy album themes. I am by no means the best, I have a long ways to go. However, I hope you take the time to give me a chance and listen to my music, and understand what I am really trying to say here. Thank you.", image: "https://i0.wp.com/horrorcorewiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/shadow-x.jpg?w=500&ssl=1")
