Artist.create!(name: "Insane Clown Posse", bio:"Insane Clown Posse (abbreviated as ICP), is an American hip hop duo composed of Violent J (Joseph Bruce) and Shaggy 2 Dope (Joseph Utsler). ICP has earned two platinum and five gold albums. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the entire catalog of the group has sold 6.5 million units in the United States and Canada as of April 2007. The group has established a dedicated following called Juggalos numbering in the 'tens of thousands'. 

Founded in Detroit in 1989, Insane Clown Posse performs a style of hardcore hip hop known as horrorcore and is known for its elaborate live performances. Originally known as JJ Boyz and Inner City Posse, the group introduced supernatural- and horror-themed lyrics as a means of distinguishing itself stylistically. The duo founded the independent record label Psychopathic Records with Alex Abbiss as manager, and produced and starred in the feature films Big Money Hustlas and Big Money Rustlas. They formed their own professional wrestling promotion, Juggalo Championship Wrestling, and later collaborated with many hip hop and rock musicians.

The songs of Insane Clown Posse center thematically on the mythology of the Dark Carnival, a metaphoric limbo in which the lives of the dead are judged by one of several entities. The Dark Carnival is elaborated through a series of stories called Joker's Cards, each of which offers a specific lesson designed to change the 'evil ways' of listeners before 'the end consumes us all'. The original lineup of Insane Clown Posse was John Utsler (John Kickjazz), Joe Bruce (Violent J) and Joey Utsler (Shaggy 2 Dope). John Utsler left before Carnival of Carnage was released in 1992.

Insane Clown Posse's performance style is often described as horrorcore hip hop, which 'utilize shocking (and blatantly over-the-top) narratives to give an over-exaggerated, almost cartoon-like version of urban deprivation in Detroit', according to author Sara Cohen. Bruce and Utsler describe many of their lyrics as being tongue-in-cheek. The group's early work features a raw, minimalistic sound, which later evolved into a more rock-oriented style. The group's lyrics serve as morality tales, with songs focusing on subjects such as cannibalism, murder and necrophilia. Insane Clown Posse's debut album, Carnival of Carnage, features a politically-oriented focus, criticizing elitism and prejudice against those who live in the ghetto, while the album's liner notes criticize the Gulf War. The group's lyrics have opposed racism, bigotry, domestic violence, and child abuse.

Insane Clown Posse has covered songs by Geto Boys, Sly Fox, and Above the Law. Bruce and Utsler refer to Ice Cube, Awesome Dre, Geto Boys, and Esham as influences on their own music, while Bruce has expressed admiration for Gong, Pearl Jam, and Michael Jackson. Mike E. Clark's production for the group incorporates elements such as 'carnival organ riffs, power chords and shotgun blasts…banjolike plucking and Van Halen-esque guitar squeals', while Bruce and Utsler sometimes alternate between rapping and screaming. Bruce has credited pop music as an influence on some of the group's material, even terming the music 'Wicked Pop'. Bruce has also stated 'We do our own genre of music'. In his review of The Tempest, Allmusic's David Jeffries writes that Bruce and Utsler 'in a carnival barker fashion that fits with their circus motif, their Insane Clown disguises, and Mike E. Clark's big top-inspired production.' Insane Clown Posse has influenced similar acts, such as Axe Murder Boyz, Blaze Ya Dead Homie and Boondox.

Artist.create!(name: "Necro", bio: " Ron Raphael Braunstein (born June 7, 1976), better known by his stage-name Necro, is an American rapper from Brooklyn. He is the owner of Psycho+Logical-Records founded November 1999. He is the younger brother of rapper Ill Bill.

Necro was born in Brooklyn, New York and grew up in the Glenwood Houses, where he lived for eight years from about 6 years old to age 14, when he moved to Canarsie. Born into a Jewish family, he is the son of Israeli expatriates, with ancestry from Israel and Romania. Necro's father was a Romanian-born Israeli soldier and his mother an Orthodox baal teshuva.

He began his musical career at 11, playing in a death metal band named Injustice. He made a transition from heavy metal to hip hop. In 1988, he started rapping after being influenced by his older brother, rapper Ill Bill. Necro derived his stage-name from the Slayer song 'Necrophiliac'. Before that he called himself 'Mad Mooney', which was a character from a Clive Barker book. He made his first demo in about 1990 and won a demo battle contest on the Stretch Armstrong and Bobbito show on WKCR-FM. In about 1993 Necro started rapping full-time and made a demo called 'Do The Charles Manson'. In 1995 he proceeded to rap on the Wildman Steve and DJ Riz show WBAU 90.3FM.

Necro plays a hip-hop subgenre called horrorcore. He has played rap metal and has combined rap with death metal music. Necro refers to his music as 'death rap' to describe his style of ultraviolent hip hop and to distinguish himself from other genre labels created by the media. His music combines death metal beats with explicit raps about violence, death, the occult, drugs and sex.

Necro is known for releasing conceptual songs. Songs have tackled topics like the Manson murders: 'Creepy Crawl' 'Cockroaches', 'Scalpel', 'The 12 King Pimp Commandments', 'Dead Body Disposal', 'The Human Traffic King', 'White Slavery' 'I Need Drugs', 'Food For Thought', 'S.T.D.', picking up women ('86 Measures of Game'), cannibalism ('Human Consumption'), suicide ('You Did It'), bondage and sex games ('EdgePlay'), watersports and micturition ('Piss'), life as a pimp ('Out the Pocket'), a revenge tale ('Some Get Back (Revenge)'), and war narratives ('First Blood').

Necro is a devoted fan of the 1983 film Scarface. Necro sampled the main character from Scarface, Tony Montana, in 'Cockroaches'. Necro has also rapped, 'I live scarface scenes' in 'Gory Days', and rapped Montana's infamous quote, 'you fuck with me you fucking with the best', whilst sampling the quote simultaneously in 'asBESTos'. Necro also took the title from 'Push It to the Limit' which appeared in the film's soundtrack and used the title for his own song 'Push it to the Limit'. Al Pacino's work besides Scarface plays a recurrent theme throughout Necro's work. Necro's new collaboration with Kool G Rap is called The Godfathers as is the movie The Godfather that made a star of Al Pacino. In 'asBESTos', Necro raps, 'I'm completely rehabilitated, reinvigorated, reassimilated' which is taken directly from an Al Pacino quote in Carlito's Way.", image: "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wQUp4rTRL._SX355_.jpg")
Artist.create!(name: "Gravediggaz", bio: "Gravediggaz was an American hip-hop group from New York City, known for its dark sense of humor and abrasive, menacing soundscapes. Gravediggaz blended hardcore hip hop, gangsta rap and heavy metal with horror elements to pioneer the hip-hop subgenre of horrorcore. 

The group was formed in 1992, bringing together Prince Paul (The Undertaker), Frukwan (The Gatekeeper), Poetic (The Grym Reaper) and RZA (The RZArector). It came about largely due to the efforts of Prince Paul. Frukwan and Prince Paul were previously together in the group Stetsasonic. According to Frukwan, the group's name means 'digging graves of the mentally dead, and it stood for resurrecting the mentally dead from their state of unawareness and ignorance.' The group's lyrics mix black humor (regarding topics such as suicide, death, killing, psychopathy, hell, etc.), criticism regarding the music industry, cartoonish violence reminiscent of the Geto Boys, and esoteric references to the Nation of Gods and Earths. The group pioneered the horrorcore genre.

The group's first album was originally to be titled Niggamortis; however, this potentially risqué title was changed to 6 Feet Deep for the American market (European versions of the album retained the original title, and also included the bonus track 'Pass the Shovel'); it was released on August 9, 1994. The four members adopted Gravedigga alter egos for their work with the group: RZA became The RZArector, Poetic became The Grym Reaper, Prince Paul became The Undertaker, and Frukwan became The Gatekeeper. In 1995, the three rapping members (without Prince Paul) released a collaborative EP titled 'The_Hell_E.P.' with UK trip hop artist Tricky.

The second full-length Gravediggaz album The Pick, the Sickle and the Shovel was less humorous, dealing more with social and political issues; it also used calmer and more conventional production. Prince Paul played a considerably smaller role in the making of this album, with many of the production duties now taken care of by RZA and his Wu-Tang affiliates (including True Master and 4th Disciple).

A bootleg Gravediggaz album surfaced in 1998, called Scenes From The Graveyard. It featured seven unreleased tracks plus some remixes from the first two albums.

Gravediggaz recruited DJ Diamond J. Poetic died of colon cancer in July 2001. Frukwan stated in an interview not long after Poetic's death that a new album using leftover Poetic material would be released. Nightmare in A-Minor, the third official album for Gravediggaz, came out in 2001; it featured two of the original members, Poetic and Frukwan. This album was their darkest work yet, including many references to Poetic's struggle with cancer, as well as apocalyptic themes to do with the teachings of the Five Percent Nation. Although RZA did not take part in the album, some Wu-Tang Clan affiliates such as 4th Disciple, True Master and Beretta 9 were involved. The album was mostly produced by Poetic and Frukwan. A different version of the album (minus the song 'Better Wake Up') was released in 2002, for which some of the tracks created by Poetic were replaced or altered.

In 2003 Frukwan released his debut solo album, Life. The fourth Gravediggaz album 6 Feet Under was released in 2004 by Cleopatra Records and featured songs from Nightmare in A-Minor and Life. According to Frukwan, he had nothing to do with the release and claimed that song titles were changed without permission, making it an unauthorized release.

In 2010, Gravediggaz recorded a new song, '2 More Cups of Blood'. In 2011, it was announced that the group had been recording new tracks involving Shabazz The Disciple & Killah Priest.

In 2018, Gatekeeper released '1 Cup of Blood' under the Gravediggaz name.", image: "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wQUp4rTRL._SX355_.jpg")

Twiztid's debut album, Mostasteless, was originally released independently by Psychopathic in 1997, but was pulled, then re-released a year later on Twiztid's new label; Island with a somewhat different track listing as a result of uncleared samples in a few songs in the original release.

Artist.create!(name: "Tech N9ne", bio: "Aaron Dontez Yates (born November 8, 1971 in Kansas City, Missouri), better known by his stage name Tech N9ne or Tecca Nina is an American rapper, co-owner of Strange Music Records and actor. His career has spanned over 24 years, during which he has released eleven albums. According to the He's a Mental Giant Songfacts, his stage name originated from the TEC-9 semi-automatic handgun, given to him by rapper Black Walt due to his fast rhyming style. (Tech is short for technique and 9 is the number of completion. That's why he says the technique's complete so often.)

His tenth studio album, K.O.D., was released October 27, 2009. He has spent his illustrious career making sure he`s been grinding harder than the average rapper, and is the best selling artist out of his hometown. With nine solo albums and two powerhouse collaboration projects under his belt, the Kansas City MC`s flow is sharper and slicker than it`s ever been.
“This is another roller coaster ride,” explains TECH N9NE about the release. “When it came time for Sickology 101, I knew I wanted to do a collabo album based on the study of being sick. It`s a beginner`s course for people who don`t know how to be sick lyrically or how to choose sick beats. It all starts with beats because they tell me exactly what to do.” Epic beats from YoungFyre, Wyshmaster, Seven and Matic Lee set the stage for TECH N9NE to weave his introspective and sometimes roguish lyrics around.

Sickology 101 brims with stellar appearances from lyrical heavyweights. On the opening title track, TECH N9NE slays alongside Chino XL and Crooked I, pulling listeners into the Hip-Hop classroom for a lesson in murdering a beat. It`s a twisted vision forged on undeniable grooves and quixotic wordplay.

The single, “Nothin,`” is an inspiring, honest anthem that features Messy Marv and Big Scoob. Meanwhile, on “Midwest Choppers 2,” TECH N9NE and Krayzie Bone cruise to the depths of darkness. “Krayzie Bone came through and murdered it,” says TECH N9NE. “I modeled the song after movies. When you do a sequel, there has to be a bigger body count and more people have to die. ‘Midwest Choppers 2` is Autobahn-style. It makes you want to speed.”

TECH N9NE`s inimitable flow and rhyming take center stage on solo tracks, including the haunting, hypnotic “Red Nose.” He doesn`t pull any punches on the vitriolic, YoungFyre-produced “Blown Away,” either. It`s an open letter to several prominent urban artists who refused to play before him at radio festivals despite his massive concert draw.

With hits like “I`m A Playa,” “Caribou Lou” (which boasts 7.2 million MySpace plays), “Riotmaker,” “Like Yeah” and “Everybody Move,” it`s no wonder TECH N9NE counts a total of over 4.5 million YouTube video plays and an average of 40,000 MySpace visitors each day. His success knows no limits. The July 2008 release, Killer, debuted at Number 1 on the Billboard Top Independent Albums chart and Number 12 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart. He did it all on his own. There was no major label — just TECH N9NE`s own record company, Strange Music. TECH N9NE`s tracks have appeared in films like Gang Related and Alpha Dog as well as various TV shows, and he recently made his motion picture debut in The Life of Lucky Cucumber alongside members of MTV`s “Jackass” crew.

It hasn`t been an easy road, but TECH N9NE soldiers on and he`ll never stop. “They call me devil worshipper because I`m different. I give you music for my core. They`re the people that put me over the million mark. I raise my middle finger to everybody who judges me because my core audience is there for me. They will always love me, but I`m trying to reach others, too. It`s not over. My music is supposed to be for everybody, but some people just don`t get it. This album is the result; swallow it. It`s middle finger music, all-day and all-night.”

TECH N9NE never stops bringing that music directly to his fans, constantly reinforcing his status as one of the hardest-touring rap acts in the business. In 2008, TECH N9NE performed over 200 shows and he doesn`t show any signs of slowing down in 2009. In April, TECH will head out in support of Sickology 101 and spend two months on the road, performing live for his rabid fans.

Sickology 101 is prepping the world for TECH N9NE`s next masterpiece, K.O.D. “I want people to know that I`m getting better and better and I`m a machine. I do these collabo albums to give the fans more. This is a bridge record to K.O.D. It`s the farewell to the TECH N9NE you`ve known lately. It`s getting darker. A lot of people might not be able to go to the place I`m going, but this place is my specialty.”

“I don`t need people to kiss my hand,” assures TECH N9NE. “I`m not trippin` on status, and I`m not a narcissist when it comes to rap. It`s my heart and soul pouring onto the paper. I write my life and I can`t hold back. This is what I know.”", image: "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Tech-N9ne-2018-cr-denny-illic-billboard-1548.jpg")

Artist.create!(name: "Brotha Lynch Hung", bio: "Brotha Lynch Hung (born Kevin Mann) is an MC and producer from Sacramento, CA who began rapping at 13. Lynch Hung's lyrics are notorious for featuring highly explicit themes, including murder, rape and cannibalism. Lynch Hung debuted with the 1993 album 24 Deep, which featured stories of the struggles involved with being affiliated with a local street gang in Sacramento's 'Garden Blocc.' Lynch Hung has also helped Master P with albums like I'm Bout It, E-40's Southwest Riders and Mr. Serv-On's Life Insurance. Lynch's first known work is his production for X-Raided's 'Niggas In Blacc' (91) and the callaboration album 'Nigga Deep' with Triple Sicx Bounty, released in 1992 and re-released in 1998.

Brotha Lynch Hung has been described as the creator of the 'horrorcore rap genre', and has sold 1.4 million cds independently. His rapping style has been described as smooth and quickly delivered.

Some listeners argue that Lynch Hung's 24 Deep album defines his musical style, but Lynch Hung has said in interviews and online forums that it does not.

Lynch Hung's second album Season of Da Siccness in 1995 proved to be the one of the most gruesome and mysogynistic Gangsta Rap albums ever released, graphically chronicling a life of drug use and sale, promiscuity, ultra-violence, rape, infanticide, and supposed cannibalism. This is Lynch's most commercially successful album, as it has now achieved gold album sales status.

Lynch Hung's lyrics are described as sicc -\ having the same meaning as the word sick but utilizing the double 'C' which is characteristic of local Crip gangsters (loccs) in Sacramento, CA and other parts of California. Lynch has stated in his song '24 Gone' that he himself is a Crip, residing in Crip areas of Sacramento has had an influence on his lyrics. He has been in gang confrontations, and he was shot once. He describes his real life experiences in his lyrics. He has since released Loaded in 1997. The next Lynch album was released in 2000 called EBK4 after a dispute with Black Market Records. The label allegedly restricted his creativity by featuring artists on the album against Lynch's will. Lynch asked his fans not to buy the album. He said 'I don't care how they get it just don't buy it or steal it'. Brotha Lynch released the DVD of Now Eat in 2000, which features a bloodthirsty and cannibalistic Lynch who goes on a rampage, killing and eating many people.

Lynch released Blocc Movement and Virus in 2001, Appearances: Book 1 in 2002, and in that same summer of 2002 he released his first DVD, Plague. Lynch's newer work includes Lynch by Inch: Suicide Note and Uthanizm in 2003, and the Now Eat DVD in 2000. In 2006 he released a collaboration with rapper MC Eiht entitiled 'The New Season.'

In May 2009, Mann signed a three album deal with Midwest rapper Tech N9ne's Strange Music label. In March 2010, he released his Strange Music debut, Dinner and a Movie, selling around 7,000 copies during its first week. His second Strange album, Coathanga Strangla, was released a year later in April 2011, and his third album with Strange Music, Mannibalector was released on February 5, 2013. The Horror-inspired trilogy told a fictional story of a crazed cannibalistic serial killer, struggling with life, family and the urge to kill. Each album debuted on the Billboard 200, and featured acts such as Snoop Dogg, Yelawolf, Hopsin and Tech N9ne among others. Following the release of the third album, Strange Music offered Mann a contract extension to keep him on the label.", image: "https://bandwagmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Lynch-Blood-All-Over-Me-1.jpg")
Artist.create!(name: "Dark Lotus", bio: "Dark Lotus is an American hip-hop supergroup based in Detroit, Michigan. Formed in 1998, the group consists of Psychopathic Records-associated rappers Joseph Bruce and Joseph Utsler of Insane Clown Posse, Jamie Spaniolo and Paul Methric of Twiztid, and Blaze Ya Dead Homie.

Dark Lotus made its debut with the single 'Echo Side', which was later released on Insane Clown Posse's 1999 album The Amazing Jeckel Brothers. It was later announced that each member 'would act as a 'petal' of the lotus,' and that there would be six members. After speculation as to who the sixth member would be, including rumors that Esham would join the group, it was announced that Marz would be a member.
  
Dark Lotus released their first album, Tales from the Lotus Pod, in 2001. Mike E. Clark was brought in to produce the album, but left the project after producing four songs, and Fritz the Cat produced the rest of the album. The album peaked at #1 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart, #6 on the Top Independent Albums chart, and #158 on the Billboard 200. Marz left the group, and was replaced by James Lowery. In 2002, Tales from the Lotus Pod was reissued in a new version removing Marz' vocals. On April 6, 2004, Dark Lotus released their second studio album, Black Rain.

It peaked at #4 on the Top Independent Albums chart, #23 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, #45 on the Top Internet Albums chart, and #45 on the Billboard 200. Allrovi reviewer Stewart Mason praised the album, writing 'Nothing on The Opaque Brotherhood will convince anyone who isn't already a fan, but the tormented lyrics and matter-of-fact delivery remove a layer or two of distance and artifice from the band's familiar themes, and make them that much more disturbing as a result.'.", image: "https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/ar0/4979182ee8f847a6c72ac1e82003a25a.jpg")

Tac and Hash continued to write songs in their own unique style. Although their music was mainly influenced by hip-hop, its intensity suggests the presence of a rock influence as well.

Their 2007 album entitled Truth In Lies is one of their most lyrically advanced albums to date and features some of the underground's most popular artists.

Artist.create!(name: "ADR Lavey", bio: "San Francisco native born and raised, started off as a DJ. Then I was recruited by a local group Polynesian Posse and at 16 was when I first stepped into a recording studio. Was approached by a childhood friend to do production and DJ work for. Friend and that's when Triple 666 was created.

Process of us recording the album little by little I started approaching the mic and I've been on the mic ever since. I bring a dark entity to the music. I try to take you on an emotional roller coaster and paint a real graphic picture for my fans.
  
Triple 666 was founded at Bank Roll Studios in San Francisco in 1991, by Fila Phil, Undertaker and myself. Then we picked Face Dog and SOS, as of now the group is no longer together, but everyone is just a phone call away if we decide we want to do any projects together.
  
“Nothing But Reality” was never pressed in a CD format. That project consisted of a few songs, the majority of the songs just featured Fila Phil only, the rest of the group was only in one song. We were testing the waters to see how people would react to it. What can be heard is a lot of street tales, from drug dealing, murder and pimp tales.

Artist.create!(name: "Anybody Killa", bio: "James Lowery (born June 26, 1973), also known as Anybody Killa, or ABK, is a rapper from Detroit, Michigan, whose stage persona is that of a Native American warrior. He is signed to Psychopathic Records. Prior to performing as ABK he performed as Native Funk.

Lowery was raised on the east side of Detroit. His parents were from Pembroke, North Carolina. Lowery's father was a preacher. His aunt and mother taught him about Native American heritage, telling him Cherokee and Lumbee legends and teaching him about dreamcatchers. Lowery started making music at a young age, using anything he could find as instruments, and began writing his own songs at the age of 13. By the age of 15, local kids were paying to watch him perform in his garage.

In 1995, he formed the group Krazy Klan with childhood friend Lavel, performing as Jaymo and J-ho, respectively. During this period, Lowery worked at a side plant that produced parts for Chrysler. His middle finger was partially cut off in an accident. After releasing two albums independently and performing at local clubs and parties, Krazy Klan broke up.

Since going solo, Lowery has released one album under the alias Native Funk, countless solo albums as ABK, as well as working on collaborative group albums with fellow emcees — Drive-By with Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Detroit Warriors with Strict 9, and The Hav Knots with Big Hoodoo.

He has also been a part of the supergroup Dark Lotus and went on to form another record label, Native World Inc., releasing albums from various other artists throughout the years.", image: "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/rap/images/6/69/Abk.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130520210450")

Artist.create!(name: "Army of the Pharaohs", bio: "Army of the Pharaohs (most commonly abbreviated as AOTP or A.O.T.P.) is an American underground hip hop collective originating from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, formed by Jedi Mind Tricks founder Vinnie Paz in 1998. The collective has strong links to other underground east coast groups such as Outerspace, Snowgoons, La Coka Nostra, Demigodz, 7L & Esoteric, and JuJu Mob. AOTP's affiliations and member roster has changed several times since its formation.

Paz formed the outfit in the late 1990s with the original roster of Bahamadia, Chief Kamachi, Virtuoso, 7L & Esoteric, plus Jedi Mind Tricks' other member Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind. The group first released the “Five Perfect Exertions” and “War Ensemble” 12″ on Paz's short-lived Recordings in 1998, but then the underground supergroup remained silent for several years.

After a couple of successful Jedi Mind Tricks albums and a new deal with Babygrande by 2003, Paz resurrected the crew, adding OuterSpace, Celph Titled, Reef the Lost Cauze, King Syze, Des Devious, and Apathy; however, Stoupe, Bahamadia, and Virtuoso had defected from the group. Babygrande issued their “Tear It Down” 12″ and first album, The Torture Papers, in 2006. The 2007 follow-up album, Ritual of Battle, saw Jus Allah and JMT protégés Doap Nixon and Demoz joining the Pharaohs.

The Unholy Terror was released in March 2010. This album marked the return of Apathy and the addition of two new AOTP members, Block McCloud and Journalist. Two songs, “Godzilla” and “Contra Mantra”, were released before the album. This album also marked the departure of Chief Kamachi who left the group because of business issues and an apparent feud with Vinnie Paz and Apathy.

In early 2011, Paz announced on his Facebook page that In Death Reborn is due to be released in 2012, however the date was pushed back and almost seemed like it was never going to be released. Early in 2012, Houston underground MC VZilla and Connecticut's Blacastan were added to the group. Both artists have made names for themselves with their features and album releases in 2012. In Death Reborn was eventually released in April 2014. The album featured members Vinnie Paz, Apathy, Blacastan, Block McCloud, Celph Titled, Demoz, Des Devious, Doap Nixon, Esoteric, Lawrence Arnell, King Magnetic, King Syze, OuterSpace, Reef the Lost Cauze, and VZilla.

Artist.create!(name: "A-Game", bio: "A-Game is a recording artist originally from Bradenton, Florida hailing from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Pursuing a career in music was a dream that A-Game had since he was only 5 years old. At age 14, that dream quickly became reality when he began investing into recording equipment, actively seeking out criticism of his early work from peers who weren't afraid to hurt feelings and be brutally honest, which was something an introverted, shy teen just starting out needed to hear to improve.

Eventually, A-Game reunited with an old friend from high school who recently just got out of juvenile hall known as The Bird, and began making music on an almost daily basis under the group Zoo Crew, which had over 20 members at one point in time. Shortly after, Bird and A-Game began forming their own supergroup, known as “Skrewz Loose” which was a duo group formed by the two. At age 16, his first time performing live was when Hopsin pulled him onstage to rap next to him in front of a sold out show of 2,000 plus people. A nerve-racking experience, but this ultimately was A-Game's breakthrough. By that time next year, he was already doing shows in his local Florida scene, dominating stages in Saint Petersburg, Tampa, Orlando, and more.
  
In 2017, A-Game became an official member of Judah Priest (Wu-Tang Clan's Brooklyn Zu/Zu Bulliez)'s 144,000 Chosen Few, beginning to do shows more frequently in the northeast and quickly building a following in the Philly/New Jersey hip hop scene. In 2019, A-Game left the Chosen Few to pursue his own path.
  
Fast forward to now, he has performed multiple times in over half the United States of America. He currently has 5 mixtapes released, and 2 albums.

Artist.create!(name: "Bake Lo", bio: "Charles baker (born on march 1st, 1994), better known by his stage name Bake Lo, has been quoted to be one of the hardest working artists around. Not only because of the immense energy that he brings to the stage and microphone, but also because of what he does behind the scenes. He has a willingness to work that leave some intimidated. This artist comes hardcore with an intricate but clear way of rhyming with his very own, unique style of music. Growing up in the small but mighty city of Ecorse, MI wasn't always easy. Other than being located on the outskirts of Detroit, the city was riddled with problems.

Growing up in a low income household taught Bake the struggles of adulthood early on in his life. Between having to start working at a young age to help his family's income and living in a household that was on the verge of falling apart; he learned. He learned that life was going to be a roller coaster that he might not be able to hold on to. Regardless, he did not let it stop him. He was soon introduced to the idea of making music by his childhood friend Bradly Gibson (RIP), who originally got Bake Lo into recording his first few songs. At first, the songs were nonsense because Bake couldn't quite find his sound. It wasn't until he was arrested at age 15 and sent to a juvenile facility to really reflect on his life when he finally channeled his inner emotion into his writing,

At that point, he began to feel a release when writing about his life and the struggles around him. It was soon that he began to master his unique sound of Wicked Truth. He was eventually introduced to an artist by the name of Ikkurruz that really helped Bake Lo get the initial push that he needed. He officially booked Bake Lo for his first show in 2011 and Bake made sure that he sold every single ticket that he was given, plus more, which lead to bigger opportunities. One opportunity in which he met his soon to be (Native World Inc) label partner, Anybody Killa. Leaving behind his job at a liquor store, Bake Lo did his first national tour at the age of 17 with ABK and Blaze Ya Dead Homie as Drive By. He later went on to do countless tours and shows throughout the span of a couple years with many other artists.", image: "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6761610000e5eb860a9f73cf95cc27226a1ab7")

Artist.create!(name: "Bankrupt Records", bio: "Bankrupt Records began as a closet experiment in rural Georgia, as brothers James G and JG (collectively known as DUO) began creating music out of their closet with limited funds and no financial support. The duo created Bankrupt Records, a launchpad to release music and named it so for the lack of money and finances involved in creating the music.

The DUO collaborated with local artists, such as the Medicine Man and Big C, and released a 2005 album titled “Underground Mythology.” Bankrupt Records would begin performing live and began spreading their influence across Georgia and the Southeast. Bankrupt soon teamed up with the rap group Southern Hustlas Incorporated (SHI) based out of Covington, Georgia and released a super group album titled “The League” featuring Bankrupt, SHI, and West Virginia artist Sike Sick. This album was very successful and sold thousands of physical units and lead to Bankrupt opening shows for acts such as D12, Twiztid, Hed PE, Kottonmouth Kings, Blaze, ABK, and Gangsta Boo, and performing at musical festivals such as Strictly for the Wicked and The Gathering.

Bankrupt would then release their first all DUO project, “Night Vision,” and would continue to tour the underground scene in the Southeast, hitting local pubs, bars, parties, and bigger venues. Bankrupt Records would then release their first professionally recorded studio album, “Double Vision,” featuring appearances from Hopsin, Bizarre, Bizzy Bone, Lil Wyte, Royce da 5'9″, and others, and would go on to do extremely well and further their influence across the South.

Bankrupt also released another GA compilation titled “Gods and Generals” and helped shed light on rising talent such as Rittz by providing a mixtape to push and shows to network and perform on.

Then he attempted to kill himself twice. The funny part is that both times music saved his life. The first was a song called “Gore Hop,” which was rapped by both Hex Rated and Insane Poetry.
  
And the second time was from Statik G's ALL OUT OF NORMAL album. However, this was never in his playlist. It just was randomly added. The song that saved his life from that album was “Night Without End.”

Artist.create!(name: "Bootleg", bio: "Dayton Family founder Bootleg not only made a name for himself in the Midwest hardcore rap underground as a member of the infamous Flint, MI, group but also as a solo artist. While many MCs rap about crime and the gangsta lifestyle, few can actually back up their talk. No stranger to crime or prison, Bootleg is one of the few hardcore rappers who speaks directly from experience. It's this sincerity and experience that sets him apart from his wannabe peers, making him one of the Midwest's most notorious hardcore rappers.

After joining forces with fellow Flint MCs Shoestring and Matt Hinkle, Bootleg tagged the trio the Dayton Family in commemoration of the shady, crime-ridden street they called home. By 1995 the trio had released their first album, What's on My Mind?, followed a year later by the gold-selling F.B.I. While both albums generated a substantial amount of attention and hype in the underground hardcore rap scene, the law unfortunately intervened, and the group members soon found themselves behind bars for various crimes. Of course, prison wasn't a new experience for Bootleg. In fact, he'd spent the greater part of the '90s behind bars, accumulating priceless experiences that fueled his criminal-minded rhymes.
  
Once Bootleg finally got out of prison, he used every free moment to work on his solo debut, 1999's Death Before Dishonesty. Unfortunately, partly because of the three-year interval since F.B.I., Bootleg's debut didn't sell as well as hoped for, and Relativity Records quickly parted ways with the troubled rapper. In 2001, Bootleg returned to the rap game, though, joining forces with the Detroit-based Overcore label (Esham, Natas).

Over the last 5 or so years as of this writing, Tha Butcher has consistently evolved, expanded, and broadened his skill level as far as lyrics, content, and overall variety of styles.
  
His drive and motivation has led to him getting signed to Klinikly Dead Entertainment as of early 2021.
  
His “go to” is, has been, and always will be, tha dark side.
  
His literal intelligence and knowledge level of “certain things” we'll just say, is indicated and hinted at, throughout his entire career.
  
With an extensive criminal record and 3 decades worth of inpatient hospitalizations, it's definitely safe to say, Tha Butcher is not only an artist, but a human/demon hybrid, that you would definitely want on your side, and/or on your team.
  
This is 110% an individual you do NOT want to confront in real life.
  
The lyrics are not a gimic by any means. This is real life self expression, of what has ALREADY BEEN, seen, done, or thought about.
  
No longer the “new guy” in the underground, Tha Butcher has made it his life's mission, to not only EARN but to COMMAND his respect.
Not only in music, but in life.
  
Tha Butcher takes this VERY seriously.
  
And his music, will ALWAYS be, a reflection of his REAL LIFE STORY.

He started horrorcore music at a very young age when he was in the 8th grade in the year of 2006; he progressed more and more until he became serious with his music and started recording it for the first time when he graduated out of High School in the year of 2010. He had contacted with a local producer named Soerangit Aniff aka Mo from his hometown of San Jose, CA who actually has been working with a lot of well known talented MCs including Kung Fu Vampire (once) and producing beats. Chuckklez started out with one of his very dark tracks that he wrote “Mental Patient©” which is actually an influence by real life Psychopaths, Murderers and parts of his childhood memories. But he wanted it to be kept in the darkness until the time was right and started writing more Sick music for his pleasure. Since then in 2011, he finally released it along with a new track “Keep the Heads and Eat the Rest©” which was inspired by the movie Sin City and became well known in the underground today.
  
He has worked and collaborated with one of the most well known and talented MCs from the U.S. to overseas such as Scum, Insane Poetry, Dosia Demon, DJ Lil Sprite, Zomb' G, Skyler Torquemada (Italy), Kaotic Klique, Dark Half, Legacey, Wolff, Phr0zen, Omega Sin, Insane Loc, Bloodshot, KGP, MC Cumblood from Butchers Harem, 089 Clique, Rozz Dyliams, and much much more.

Artist.create!(name: "Creech", bio: "Creech is an artist from the Netherlands. Creech, formerly “Creature C,” started to dislike that name as the “C” didn't have a meaning and he wanted to have a catchier name. At some point, Cyanide (R.I.P.) called Creature C “Creech” and he liked that, so he stuck with that name. He developed his style in the golden era by listening to old school hip-hop over and over again. Growing up with four brothers meant that Creech was always surrounded by different forms of music.

His first intro to hip-hop came when he heard Kool Moe Dee's “Go See The Doctor” performed by other kids during a performance in a classroom. A few years later, he joined a basketball club and joined a hip-hop group called Black Pound.

At that time, Creech started buying music equipment. With that, he started mixing beats with any mixable melody he liked. As the group Black Pound disappeared, Creech continued solo.

Creech discovered a section at MP3.com where artists posted horrorcore hip-hop. From there, he discovered a forum board called horrorcore.com where he met other horrorcore artists and beatmakers. That's when Creech started buying beats from skilled producers such as Bob e. Nite, DJ Shy One, Bad Mind, and Komatose.

Creech always dug the dark side of hip-hop and that's been his style for a long while. At some point Creech had a different alias, “Rawhead Rex.” Rawhead Rex only recorded one song and it was never released, only online.

As Creech got older, he started to get a little tired of writing horrorcore lyrics, and so he started to write lyrics about other things as well. He also started rapping in Dutch because he felt that rapping in his native language was more natural and that way he didn't have to concentrate too much on the pronunciation of English words.

Old school hip-hop is the music Creech knows best and it's fair to say that the Ultramagnetic MC's, BDP, Tim Dog, the Geto Boys, and Desmond Dekker are his biggest influences. Although Creech is hip-hop through and through, it is not to say he finds himself restricted to this genre. In fact his influences are vast, which is noticeable throughout his albums, especially his debut release.", image: "https://i0.wp.com/horrorcorewiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/creech.jpg?w=339&ssl=1")

Then while vacationing in VA Beach, VA in 2000 and producer-less, he met a producer by the name of Gemini da Golden Child, owner of Gemini Productions, who in turn was on the verge of giving it all up after difficulties ranging from disloyal artists to snakes in the business.

Artist.create!(name: "DamneDNatioN", bio: "DamneDNatioN has been writing, preparing and recording since 1999. The group was first established as Concussion and soon changed their name to a more fitting DamneDNatioN.

In 2005, they performed their first big show with King Gordy, Psycho Jesus, and other local artists.
  
In between shows, they have been recording, making music videos, etc.
  
In 2006 and 2007, DamneDNatioN started working on solo material during the recording of new music together. Some of which has been performed at various events.
  
DamneDNatioN took some time in 2007 [and beyond] to work at haunted houses in Indianapolis, making new connections each year.
  
Upon releasing new music in 2008, they still continued to perform at a large ammounts of shows.
  
In 2009, the quality of DamneDNatioN's music began to improve, shifting from what they would describe as “decent” to crystal clear. In 2010, the plan of getting an LLC was in place with the desire to start their own label. This finally happened in 2011, leading to also signing additional artists to the roster. In 2013, music videos for DamneDNatioN's “Wasps in my Brain” and Highly Xplicit's “Church Burners” featuring Mr. Lokust and DamneDNatioN were filmed. That same year, DBR, the label, was laid to rest.
  
The year 2013 was still filled with good shows and good music, but a new home was needed for the two emcees. They (and some fellow artists) decided that it was way overdue for DamneDNatioN to join forces with Shadow Walkaz Ent., so they did so in late 2014.
  
DamneDNatioN have always been heavily influenced by a wide variety of music and have pushed themselves through the years to always sound unlike any other artist. Their delivery them has always been unique and unmatched to anything else in the state; They don't sound like every other hip hopper in the city.
  
With horror concepts laced over dark club beats or sinister sounds, they have raised the bar for themselves consistently for years.
  
Upon working with Shadow Walkaz Ent. (Highly Xplicit, The Lyrical Freakshow and Mr. Lokust) DamneDNatioN has progressed and upped their game, proving once again that they can butcher with the best of them.
  
In 2015, Shadow Walkaz showed signs of dissipating, so measures were taken and 3rd Shift Entertainment wanted to do a joint venture with SWE and other labels. The joint venture didn't work out in the long run, but DN's LP, “Illuminated,” was successfully released on SWE and 3SE.
  
In 2016, the group signed with DurtiMyndz Ent. and Released “Satan's Hymen,” along with a video for “Lake of Fire,” among other things. They have been consistently creating and releasing ever since.
  
DamneDNatioN has done shows with countless artists including:
Potluck, Glasses Malone, J Hornay, Lil Wyte, Scum, Smallz One, Mastamind, Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid, Dark Half, Leaders of the Lost, Mars, Polk Frost, Kutt Kalhoun, !Mayday!, Damien Quinn, King Gordy, Esham, Blaze ya Dead Homie, ABK, The R.O.C, A.X.E, DJ Clay, Boondox, Lo Key, Prozak, Zug Izland, Twisted Insane, Bloodshot, KGP, Con-Crete, Stitch Mouth, Psycho Jesus, Mistah Fab, Young Wicked, Bukshot, Ouija Macc, and The Dirtball.", image: "https://i.discogs.com/iPWgt-uyjF22lvOaxO9tPzqGqv30LYCODAT2h5fHXpM/rs:fit/g:sm/q:40/h:300/w:300/czM6Ly9kaXNjb2dz/LWRhdGFiYXNlLWlt/YWdlcy9BLTU5MzA1/ODktMTUzMDU5MzE5/OC00NzU4LmpwZWc.jpeg")

It also contained production from Fritz The Cat and Stir Crazy. The group would spend the next year promoting and creating the next project “Nightmarez.” The group refused to release any information about the album including a release date.

Artist.create!(name: "Dead Poets", bio: "Dead Poets is an American hip hop duo from New Jersey, consisting of rapper/producer “Tab” and rapper “Renagade”. They perform both as the group, Dead Poets, and independently in an array of venues.

Based from Roselle, NJ, they have built an impressive following within the Tri-State area and are expanding rapidly across the country. They were originally known as “Dead Poet Society”, but later changed the group's name to “Dead Poets”. The group's style consists true to the hip-hop foundation of lyrical skills with themes across the board, from love and hate to the urban party scene.
  
With a large portion of the production done by “Tab”, the self-taught musician (guitars, live drums, programming) uses a mixture of samples and live instruments to create boom-bap heavy melodic tunes, infusing anything from old school rap to rock to reggae. Their infused melodies are complimented well with sung hooks by both. The group consists mainly of the 2 rappers, but expands by 4 additional members to a hip-hop/rock live band (Empyre Village) for shows. They are often compared to a mix between “Wu Tang Clan” meets “Sublime”.
  
Dead Poets have independently released three mix-tape/albums: “The Kenny Chang Tapes” in 2008, “To The Grave” in 2009, and “The Empty Bottle Project” in 2010 all available for free download at http://www.empyrevillage.com now. The group has collaborated with artists such as “Mr Doitall” (Lords Of The Underground), Pacewon (Outsidaz), and many others.

The duo have shared the stage with acts “Wu Tang Clan”, “Red Cafe”, “Masta Ace”, “Sadat X” (Brand Nubian), “Immortal Technique”, “Jedi Mind Tricks”, “Outsidaz”, “Artifacts”, and many more.", image: "https://i0.wp.com/horrorcorewiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/dead-poets.jpg?w=305&ssl=1")

“I started this over 15 years ago, I was 13 years old, it first began with poetry. Its always been about expression for me. Its a vent to let out the emotions, A door for me to open and let my inner turmoil, thoughts and aggressions out. My mental therapy keeping me sane while I deal with the everyday struggle we call life. Everything I ever have gotten in life, I had to fight for. I would def say since I started this journey I been engulfed and overwhelmed on the bottom crawling toward this Goal. I Tried to stay focused on my dream while in the trenches battling my demons and everyone else's, My loved ones dying, the ones I love around me betraying me the whole way, putting everything I have into something and watching it fall apart and burn because people lack the honor and loyalty I give. How can a pure soul not become Dirty in this world? I don't understand it yet, but I have faith and its got me this far. I cant count the times I lost it all (Financially, Spiritually, Mentally) and had to rebuild from nothing . Its stained my soul and my flesh Ill never be the same so I accept the dirt and the struggle, and embraced it having faith I can use this to help others overcome the battle and myself, because its all I know….. This new album reflects that in every aspect from the artwork to the content on every song.

Artist.create!(name: "Dirty Crowley", bio: "Dirty Crowley is an American hip hop artist originally from Utah, now residing in Littleton Colorado. Dirty derives from the lifelong nickname Dirty (his real name being Dustin). He added Crowley onto the end to set himself apart from the many other rappers named Dirty. It was adopted from Aleister Crowley (considered one of the most evil people ever) and with his style of Hardcore Hip Hop known as Horrorcore he transformed the name “Dirty Crowley.”

Dirty Crowley was into Gangsta Rap growing up and listened to Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, 2Pac, and Coolio. At the age of 13, his friend showed him ICP and he fell in love with all the crazy lyrics that he heard on their albums. The style being so different than anything else at that time, he started exploring other artists who were starting to do similar things with their music and it grew from there.

His first live performance was back in 2006. He and his friends set up a PA several times at a park pavilion and spit offensive lyrics until someone was offended enough to call the police and shut it down. He had his first real show opening for King Gordy and then took a break from performing to start putting his albums together.

In August of 2015, he released his first EP, Poisonous Noise, with features from GrewSum, Insane Poetry, Trips, Labratz, Dr. EDrum, and Slyzwicked. From July 2014 to July 2015 he spent a year as co-president of World Wide Wicked Shit Incorporated and then in October 2015 he signed to the label, Ash of The Phoenix Productions. In November 2015, he signed with his manager Mary Warren of Xtreme Management LLC.

Growing up in the hardcore/metal scene of New England in the early 2000s, this was not his first venture musically. He had fronted a few metalcore bands, but none of the members seemed to have the same drive, ambition, and lust for music as him.

Stepping away from music for awhile, DOWNWXLF was completely blown away when he saw the music video for Paris by the $uicideboy$. It reignited his hunger for music. Artists such as Rozz Dyliams, Ghostemane, Wavy Jones, and Ouija Macc add to the list of those who inspired him to finally stop dreaming and get to creating.
  
Heavily influenced by bands from his youth, their genres ranging from numetal to deathcore, DOWNWXLF is just trying to make his own sound and inspire others in the process. His themes center around people not being themselves (whether it's out of fear or otherwise), not promoting drug culture, and his life experiences. All with horror elements sprinkled in. He has been labeled “positively dark” by one engineer and his music called “lumbertrap” by a fellow artist, Madnes_One.
  
DOWNWXLF belongs to one small collective, F0URH0RNS, that he and fellow artist/friend BXTCHWRXSTS started in October 2019 calling it D3M80YZ at the time.

Originally wanting to be in a punk rock band when he was a teenager, (That dream came true later in life as a studio band project with Steve Sxaks & Ethan Mintz Of Marsten House Recordings Called Damn Dirty Commies) but it translated into rap when he was about 18. Without any professional studio equipment at first. But that didn't matter, his need to be heard endured.

He went by many different names before landing on DRACO, Including: The Unabomber, Draco The Unabomber and probably like 10 other ones he forgot about, (or tries to forget about)

His musical influences are:
DMX, Wu Tang Clan, The Misfits, and Twiztid. And growing up un the golden age of the Philly Punk Rock Scene (Early 2000's).
And local Horrorcore and Hip Hop Artists. Some other notable influences are the Gothic and Industrial acts that would feature at local events.

His personal influences are struggles with mental illness, and a drifting outsider perspective, which both play a role in the darker nature of his work. But in contrast to those darker elements, his Judaism, being around Anti-Fascist Activists, and the afroqueer community has given DRACO a uniquely balanced personal perspective.

With over a decade in the music industry whether it's performing music, DJing for several horrorcore/underground rap radio stations (WICKED INTENT RADIO, TKSRADIO, UTMRADIO) or writing articles for several media outlets (MortalGore, OOGEEWOOGEE, Oy Gevault!, etc.) DRACO has become an undeniable fixture in the Hardcore Hip Hop and Horrorcore Rap Scene. Last but not least, in 2021, DRACO started his own music publishing and media company called Grey6 Media, a co-label to Marsten House Records that distributes through Sony/The Orchard.", image: "https://i0.wp.com/horrorcorewiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/draco.jpg?w=640&ssl=1")

In 2005 Dean was going by the alias 2 face in a group called South East Devastation. The group was made up of Dennis “Ova dose” Wolff and himself. The group started throwing house parties in the Orlando area and quickly outgrew it with attendances well into the 60s and 70s. From there they played countless local shows in the area as well as opened for national headliners, as well as being the last group to ever play the Bomb House at the Gathering of the Juggalos.

After the two parted ways with 2 albums out. Dean partnered in creating a more “southern gangster” group with his friend Stephen “Juggernaut” Mccown called Villianaires. The group continued to grow their fan base in the area. They did two albums and decided to part ways while Stephen continued in another group “Bangerzilla.”

Dean decided to take the 2face brand solo. In the coming years he would Join Blood and Guts Records of Tampa which featured owners Hater Marc, D Murder Outbreak, Thirteen among many others. Later joining the lable would be Mizt3r Purple, Miss Kisa, Stranger Haze. They would do shows all over the country, including national tours with Miss Kisa, Psycho Jesus, Mars, Boondox and more. Countless performances at the Gathering of the Juggalos including a BNG takeover of Club Chaos.

The rich history and never ending shows and adventures dwindled down over the years as everyone grew up, went to prison, started families and moved on, leaving 2face not knowing where to go.

After his mothers death Dean created the fictional town of Autumndale and focused on his first 3 graphic novels and 2 full length films.
In 2018 music called again but having left the life of drug and alcohol use behind, he needed to re-brand. Thus was born Destiny Everything and Nothing.

At the time heavily influenced by greats like 2pac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G, N.W.A, LL cool J, Run DMC, Snoop Dogg and more. Using music as a coping mechanism to overcome early signs of depression and anxiety he used music asa n outlet to escape his surroundings.

After run ins with local law enforcement he was forced to grow up quick and find a different way to express his anger and emotions. In his late teenage years he began to write and record his own material touching on life events and things that he had seen and been through, just the everyday struggle. After high school he was involved in the local music scent but never really took music seriously, it was just something to be a part of and a way to cope with hiss issues. After the tragic passing of his son in October 2005 he began to take music more seriously and really decided to pursue music fully. But along the way there were several roadblocks and obstacles in the way that derailed his progress drastically. After releasing several projects between 2008-2014 the end seemed to be creeping up fast.

After taking several years off and deciding to give up on his dreams one more giant push. In the winter of 2017 he made his return to the music scene with his album Verbal Disease. He decided to give everything he had to his music and never look back. With this new grind or die mindset he began to make noise and become noticed in the underground scene.

He began really solidifying his name and brand in the underground. Named the Voice of The Misfits by his peers he began speaking to the masses with that dark and rugged style all of his own. In 2020 while the world was in a crisis he linked back up with long time family Devil Boy aka Wicked Wayz who was fresh out the system and ready to leave his mark on the world.

Artist.create!(name: "Fat Killahz", bio: "Prepare yourself, the “World Famous” Fat Killahz have arrived! Hailing from the war-torn streets of Detroit, Michigan, the Killahz are made up of four imposing emcees: Fatt Father, ShimEBangO, Marvwon, and King Gordy.

All four are veterans of the same open mic and battle circuits that birthed the likes of Eminem, D12, Slum Village, and Royce da 5'9″. All four are proficient, battle-tested lyricists. All four are explosive performers with a love for the music. All four are also constantly hungry, for hip-hop as well as hamburgers.

Fatt Father (Fatts) is the leader of the group. Fatts is capable of going from personable to menacing in a matter of moments; lyrically vivid yet down to earth, his descriptive tales of the pleasure and pain of street life pull you into his world.

ShimEBangO, maybe the largest member, possesses an agile, quick-witted flow that's as colorful as the trademark throwback jerseys he wears. His unmistakable voice lends energy and inertia to every track he blesses.

Marvwon is a verbal flamethrower. His style is a flammable mixture of antagonistic street braggadocio and humorous pop culture references that's guaranteed to have you hitting that rewind button.

King Gordy is indescribable, an enigma wrapped in a scowling horn-headed visage, furiously spitting rapid-fire gothic venom, yet still capable of turning heads and opening ears with a unique and soulful brand of singing. Yes, singing.

The Fat Killahz began in 2001 as an inside joke between Marvwon and Fatt Father. The joke turned into serious business; they enlisted heavyweights ShimEBangO and King Gordy shortly thereafter. Seemingly overnight, open mic after open mic was ransacked by the four fat and furious emcees. Tearing down local spots like the Lush Lounge, the Blind Pig, Motor, St. Andrew¹s Hall and the Shelter, and the State Theater, FK rapidly gained respect in the streets and a devoted following. Battle opponents and fellow emcees quickly learned that FK was nothing to play with; all four emcees were skilled lyricists and engaging performers, and as a group they gradually developed a unique sound: heavy, thumping street anthems, melodic, bouncy tracks to ride to, humorous hood stories, and healthy doses of comic relief. After smashing a number of venues (including a raucous, shirtless performance at the 2002 Impact Convention,) the Killahz decided it was time to hit the studio.

They released the 2 Fat, 2 Furious mixtape to positive reactions throughout Detroit city, and the public just wanted more. Making an appearance on King Gordy¹s solo album The Entity, the single Fat-Tastic 4 rose to #1 on the college hip-hop charts. Fans still weren't satisfied. FK followed up a successful run supporting Gordy as the opening act on D12's US tour in 2004 with the release of their WFKR 31.3 FKM mixtape.

They were finally treated to the full-length they had been waiting for: on March 15th, 2005, Guess Who's Coming To Dinner? was released. Featuring production from hard hitters such as Denaun Porter (D-12, 50 Cent, Young Buck) and B.R. Gunna (Slum Village), Guess Who's Coming To Dinner? displays the Fat Killahz dynamic song writing, vivid street savvy lyrical poetry, and comedic wit. With a distribution plan in place, hip-hop heads across the country better prepare themselves to deal with the world's largest group. Fatt Killahz are currently working on their sophomore album titled Fat Tuesday.", image: "https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/ar0/51c7885964354b63b64d7fa1d9275340.jpg")

Vyce became a member around 2009 and the musical quality started to improve. He rapped and mixed most of the songs from 2010 on.

Around that time, Vyce and J Sawedoff started a side project called Cult Status, that released four EPs from 2010-2014. The third Cult Status EP featured God of Fertility as a member, and the fourth EP featured Frostbite as a member. 90% of the production on these albums was done by Vyce.

J Sawedoff was also B-Cide's hypeman for a brief period of time in 2009-10.

Initially they did not wear masks; The masks started to come into play in late 2009, and then in 2012 they picked up the luchadore masks and gained new stage personas with them.

Flesruoy Llik has had an insane amount of lineup changes and collaborators that have come and gone and sometimes came back again, but the core of the group was always the two Jeremys, and Joey Martian (Vyce/Gloom Rap).

Live shows have been very violent with self-harm and members causing harm to each other (staple guns, kendo sticks, steel chairs, body slams on thumb tacks) and sometimes even using the weapons on willing participants of the crowd.

Beginning his music career in 2002, F.E.T.U.S has crafted a new breed of music that combines Eastcoast flavor and instrumental with Southern influence and Midwest rhyme schemes to keep each verse, and ultimately song, fresh and new feeling. Calling his fans “Abortions,” the Florida native represents a darker and less often seen side of music; a style that has never been given life previously.

Earlier albums such as “Every City’s A Columbine” and “Abortion Theory” showcase an anxious side of the artist, with a general theme of urgency that most believe translates to a thirst for fame and musical acceptance that has been unquenched. Later albums like 2010’s “Deceptikonz” with fellow artist ClaAs show a more laid back acceptance of the music business, from the eyes of a more mature F.E.T.U.S.

In 2011, F DOT and recording group “Akvon” with Psycho Jesus and Lyrikal teamed up with Mad Insanity founder Mars to bring the Gospel Of The Grave Tour to a nationwide audience. Gaining steam from all states involved lead to an electrifying performance at The Gathering of the Juggalos in August of 2011; an annual event hosted by the Insane Clown Posse that has included performances by Tech N9ne, Ice Cube, Busta Rhymes, Mushroomhead, and Bone Thugs N Harmony.

In 2008, Dux kicked doors down when he was asked to be on the “Tunnel Runners” CD, a Hatchet House release. With the song “Die 2nite,” Dux contributed an official banger to the project which made its way to the “Top 25 Rap Albums” on the Billboard charts.

In 2009, Dux released an album with Maniac, a South Dakota MC , whose rhymes were very similiar to his.With Maniac also producing all the tracks on the LP, Dux laid all the hooks to this masterpiece that would then be called “Daywalkers: Dead by Dawn”. This 19 track disc has sold close to 2,000 copies in the Midwest and Southeast alone.

Dux’s most recent release “Welcome to Granville” shows his diverse style, from street anthems like “In My Town” Feat Jelly Roll (Wyte Music/Hypnotized Minds) and bangers like “S.U.S” which shows Dux lyrical & metaphorical flows. WTG is Dux 3rd project and is his best work to this day.

Born Jaron Johnson in Richmond, California, the Bay Area MC adopted his stage moniker from a childhood nickname, Geronimo, and was influenced as much by Wu-Tang as he was Dragon Ball Z, slasher flicks, and Mortal Kombat. With a style that combined Twiztid, Esham, and early-era Eminem, G-Mo debuted with Hopsin on the track “Shit Bowl” in 2010. He released his own mixtape, Got Filth, in 2011, and its sequel, Got Filth: The Great Adventures of G-Mo, in 2012. The Android FiLFTEEN EP arrived in 2015, produced by C-Lance, the Massachusetts-born in-house producer for Jedi Mind Tricks.

G-Mo signed with Majik Ninja Entertainment and issued My Filthy Spirit Bomb in late 2016. The album debuted in the Billboard 200 and broke into the Top Five of the rap chart.

Hopsin, who dropped out earlier that year, was sent to Los Angeles County Jail where he spent a year. Upon his release in 2005 he began to pursue a career in music, purchased a microphone, and installed FL Studio (known as FruityLoops at the time) on his computer. He credits Eminem as the rapper that initially got him interested in hip hop music.

In 2007, he was signed to Ruthless Records, and had founded his own record label, Funk Volume, in 2009. He would then go on to found another record label, Undercover Prodigy, in 2016.

The original lineup reunited in 2013 and currently perform together at times under the HOK moniker. They released a box set and new music in 2018.

Hektic and Mr. Bones left the group in 1996 to form Twiztid, changing their stage names respectively to Monoxide and Jamie Madrox, which put the group on a temporary hiatus. In 1997, The R.O.C. resurrected House of Krazees, changed his stage name to Sol, and continued to perform under the House of Krazees name (for one album, to fulfill contractual obligations for one more H.O.K. album) with rapper Skrapz (formerly of 2 Krazy Devils with Psycho C). This new edition of House of Krazees released one album in 1999, “The Night They Kame Home,” and the House of Krazees name was retired by the fall of 1999. Sol and Skrapz left their old manager “Uncle Kreepy”, and formed the duo HaLFBrEEd, releasing the majority of their material on their own record label, Virus Independent.

HaLFBrEEd was active up until 2003, after only four years of activity. In 2013, it was rumored and semi-announced that HaLFBrEEd was reuniting after a decade apart. Similarly, it was rumored around this time that House of Krazees were reuniting as well with the original lineup of Sol (who later changed his name back to The R.O.C.), Jamie Madrox, and Monoxide. However, nothing came of these rumors, despite another House of Krazees compilation album being released in 2013, “Casket Cutz”, which was sold through Twiztid’s online store.", image: "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/thumb/vrwrss1503812097.jpg")

Artist.create!(name: "Intrinzik", bio: "Intrinzik, born Scott Glass (Will), is an American rap artist from Phoenix, Arizona. He spent several years fronting the rap/metal trio known as Fallguy before starting his solo career. Through touring with Psychopathic Record’s Twiztid and doing shows with Strange Music’s Tech N9ne and other underground rap artists in the southwest region, Fallguy and Intrinzik built a loyal following of juggalos as well as underground rap and metal followers. Intrinzik started Intrinz INK Records in 2002 to release Fallguy’s debut album, “Trapped Inside.”

Intrinzik started his music career behind the drum kit and as primary songwriter for punk/metal bands such as Washington DC based Unabomer and Phoenix based Dickie Staboner.

Intrinzik and long time collaborator Joe Dank then started the band Fallguy in 2001. Starting out as a 5 piece hardcore rap group, the band was forced to run all of its rhythm tracks on DAT as they were offered the opening slot on Twiztid’s “Mirror Mirror” tour with limited resources. The handful of dates the band performed on quickly gained them a cult following as fans began showing up wearing ski masks, Intrinzik’s trademarked disguise. The now 3 piece band went on to penetrate the underground rap market with the release of their 2003 self titled EP which contained the memorable anthem “Getchyoskimaskon.”

Fallguy continued to do shows in the southwest including the South By Southwest festival in both 2002 and 2003 opening up showcases featuring Mushroomhead, Anybody Killa, and Zug Izland. The band disassembled in 2004 shortly after the release of their biggest release to date entitled “Apocalypse 6T7″ that gained the band a distribution in Japan via RB-Records.com. The number 67 was used by fans to call out the letters F and G. Lead guitarist Driver Williams went on to join country music star Eric Church’s band and rhythm player Joe Dank moved to Chicago, IL to work in marketing for a Randall Amplifiers.

Intrinzik continued his solo career performing live with Bionic Jive front man Emerg McVay and quickly released Emerg’s “Slave Music: Post 911 Lyricism” on Intrinz INK as well as his own solo debut “Double U I Double L in 2004.” Intrinzik, Emerg, Ako Mack (Bionic Jive), McNastee, Menacide, Jason Porter and Slim then teamed up for a horrorcore super group Seperated at Birth and released “Nothing Like You” in both US and Japan in 2005 on Intrinz INK/RB-Records.

INT then started touring as a solo artist with Arizona based Phunk Junkeez and collaborating with Cappadonna of WU Tang Clan, Phunk Junkeez, McNastee and more to create his 2005 sophomore solo release “Tricks of the Trade.” TOTT was released both in USA and Japan and solidified Intrinzik as a solo artist.

Intrinzik then released McNastee’s underground classic “Pieces of a Broken” man in 2006 on Intrinz INK as the two would continue to perform in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Utah, Colorado, and Arizona markets.

Later in 2006, Intrinzik then released a 5 year retrospective CD/DVD entitled “My Favorite Album.” This release marked Intrinzik’s first fully licensed release in Japan. The album contains some of Proof of D12s final video footage and recorded material on the songs “Dead or Alive” and “My Favorite Song.” The CD also contained features from Big B (Suburban Noize), Phunk Junkeez, Cappadonna, Dirtball (Suburban Noize) and more.

Intrinzik then teamed up with Arizona based emcee Virus and released the maxi single for “Area Code” in 2007. The duo would go on to support the “Bad Mental Health” United States tour that summer with Axe Murder Boyz and Grave Plott. Intrinzik and Virus would then go on to dominate the Arizona underground by opening consistently for Tech N9ne, Andre Nickatina, Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid and most of the underground shows in the Phoenix and Tucson markets.

In 2008 Intrinzik’s song “the Calvary” was featured on Hatchet House’s 13 track compliation “Tunnel Runners” which debuted on the Billboard Rap Charts at #21 in the summer of 2008. 2008 also birthed Intrinzik’s uber successful CD compilation series, “Underground Hustlin.”

Intrinzik then relived the Fallguy era by released “Fallguy: Resurreciton” in 2008. The album recreated the Fallguy sound using producer/engineer Larry Elyea to perform the majority of the live instrumentation. The CD features collaborations with Axe Murder Boyz, Jason Cruz of Strung Out, Proof of D12, Big B and many of Intrinzik’s label mates.", image: "https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/ar0/3fdc9a63239d45a79fc6e2e5f3bbc579.jpg")

Artist.create!(name: "Jack WD", bio: "Jack Aquino, known primarily as Jack WD, was born in Lakewood, NJ on October 5, 1997.

His rap name is a combination of his real life first name and the WD as an abbreviation for “Wrestling Drummer”. In his school days, he contributing to the wrestling team where he was a co-captain his senior year and the band program as lead drummer/percussionist. He is often known as “TheWrestlingDrummer” he went to high school and even after graduating high school at 2016, he kept the name as symbolism to not forget where he came from and what built him to be the person he is.

Jack WD is often a shy and quiet person until he steps into the mic to offer a plethora of different sounds (such as trap metal, rap metal, horrorcore, speed rap and more) mixed with aggressive delivery. Jack WD has touched multiple song topics such as words of determination, violent acts, depression, and more. Overall, Jack WD considers himself as a “Whatever I Want To Make” artist and barely possesses any interest of aligning himself to a particular genre.

Most of all, he is most prominent in the underground New Jersey scene for wearing the phantom mask. The phantom mask’s main purpose is to not to be used as imagery, but Jack WD claims that the mask gives him “superpowers” by turning him into a more charismatic stage personality.

Jack does not always portray as Jack WD. He also possesses an alter ego known as “10-1 C0D3K33P3R” who is a much more brutal version of Jack WD. 10-1 C0D3K33P3R was created to allow Jack to rap about topics such as describing horrific murder, death, bodily harm towards others and pent-up rage. Jack WD has portrayed as 10-1 C0D3K33P3R since 2020 despite a couple of early SoundCloud songs being the early stages of the persona. He continues to portray as 10-1 C0D3K33P3R every October ever since.

Jack WD continues to hustle in his music journey through releasing projects and singles of versatile genres with no sign of stopping.", image: "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/561c2914e4b090a32cbb0b9c/1573045066387-C2UY88ZYH0I6S09ZE0PW/Jack+WD+IMG_2688.jpg?format=1000w")
Artist.create!(name: "Jade The Nightmare", bio: "Based out of the small neighborhood, Montbello, residing in Denver,Colorado, Jade The Nightmare remains one of the most original female artist in the surrounding area. Her sound pulls influence from the king of shock rock known as Marilyn Manson and content influence from the late great Tupac Shakur and many others.

Possessing her first microphone at the young age of 11 given to her by her father. Jade was ecstatic to write her raps first consisting of just her life as a young female artist living in a middle class African-American family in the 303. Jade’s music took an enormous turn in her later years when her father soon passed away without warning. This took a toll on her mindset and began to reflect signs of sadness and confusion in her music. Music and family were the only things that fill the void in Jade’s soul. To worsen her situation, she underwent another death in the family the following year after her father’s passing. A sense of numbness grew within her, but the one tool she used as a hobby now became an outlet to escape her conjured demons.

Jade began to develop her signature sound self-titled as “GothHop,” which is the genre she used to describe most of her music. Her music puts a dark Gothic vibe on the hardships some undergo in their life span, discussing sensitive topics such as rape, murder, poverty, depression, racism and many more. Jade’s take on music has grown into something beyond just a black girl writing raps in her mothers house.

Jade is in the early stages of her company “Death Delight Creations Inc.” as well as her independently owned record label “GothHop Empire Ent.” She has accomplished a lot before even hitting 20 years old, as of 2018. At the time of this bio, Jade has released three complete full-length self-released albums as well as one EP. She has worked with 50 other artists in and out of the United States. She has also signed with two small record labels including Unforgiven Records (2015-2016) and Pariah Music Ent (2017-present).", image: "https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-OfB6lHcfUg4pANYY-yYoTAw-t240x240.jpg")
