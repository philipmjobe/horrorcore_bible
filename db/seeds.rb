Artist.create!(name: "Insane Clown Posse", bio:"Insane Clown Posse (abbreviated as ICP), is an American hip hop duo composed of Violent J (Joseph Bruce) and Shaggy 2 Dope (Joseph Utsler). ICP has earned two platinum and five gold albums. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the entire catalog of the group has sold 6.5 million units in the United States and Canada as of April 2007. The group has established a dedicated following called Juggalos numbering in the 'tens of thousands'. 

Founded in Detroit in 1989, Insane Clown Posse performs a style of hardcore hip hop known as horrorcore and is known for its elaborate live performances. Originally known as JJ Boyz and Inner City Posse, the group introduced supernatural- and horror-themed lyrics as a means of distinguishing itself stylistically. The duo founded the independent record label Psychopathic Records with Alex Abbiss as manager, and produced and starred in the feature films Big Money Hustlas and Big Money Rustlas. They formed their own professional wrestling promotion, Juggalo Championship Wrestling, and later collaborated with many hip hop and rock musicians.

The songs of Insane Clown Posse center thematically on the mythology of the Dark Carnival, a metaphoric limbo in which the lives of the dead are judged by one of several entities. The Dark Carnival is elaborated through a series of stories called Joker's Cards, each of which offers a specific lesson designed to change the 'evil ways' of listeners before 'the end consumes us all'. The original lineup of Insane Clown Posse was John Utsler (John Kickjazz), Joe Bruce (Violent J) and Joey Utsler (Shaggy 2 Dope). John Utsler left before Carnival of Carnage was released in 1992.

Insane Clown Posse's performance style is often described as horrorcore hip hop, which 'utilize shocking (and blatantly over-the-top) narratives to give an over-exaggerated, almost cartoon-like version of urban deprivation in Detroit', according to author Sara Cohen. Bruce and Utsler describe many of their lyrics as being tongue-in-cheek. The group's early work features a raw, minimalistic sound, which later evolved into a more rock-oriented style. The group's lyrics serve as morality tales, with songs focusing on subjects such as cannibalism, murder and necrophilia. Insane Clown Posse's debut album, Carnival of Carnage, features a politically-oriented focus, criticizing elitism and prejudice against those who live in the ghetto, while the album's liner notes criticize the Gulf War. The group's lyrics have opposed racism, bigotry, domestic violence, and child abuse.

Insane Clown Posse has covered songs by Geto Boys, Sly Fox, and Above the Law. Bruce and Utsler refer to Ice Cube, Awesome Dre, Geto Boys, and Esham as influences on their own music, while Bruce has expressed admiration for Gong, Pearl Jam, and Michael Jackson. Mike E. Clark's production for the group incorporates elements such as 'carnival organ riffs, power chords and shotgun blasts…banjolike plucking and Van Halen-esque guitar squeals', while Bruce and Utsler sometimes alternate between rapping and screaming. Bruce has credited pop music as an influence on some of the group's material, even terming the music 'Wicked Pop'. Bruce has also stated 'We do our own genre of music'. In his review of The Tempest, Allmusic's David Jeffries writes that Bruce and Utsler 'in a carnival barker fashion that fits with their circus motif, their Insane Clown disguises, and Mike E. Clark's big top-inspired production.' Insane Clown Posse has influenced similar acts, such as Axe Murder Boyz, Blaze Ya Dead Homie and Boondox.

Artist.create!(name: "Necro", bio: " Ron Raphael Braunstein (born June 7, 1976), better known by his stage-name Necro, is an American rapper from Brooklyn. He is the owner of Psycho+Logical-Records founded November 1999. He is the younger brother of rapper Ill Bill.

Necro was born in Brooklyn, New York and grew up in the Glenwood Houses, where he lived for eight years from about 6 years old to age 14, when he moved to Canarsie. Born into a Jewish family, he is the son of Israeli expatriates, with ancestry from Israel and Romania. Necro's father was a Romanian-born Israeli soldier and his mother an Orthodox baal teshuva.

He began his musical career at 11, playing in a death metal band named Injustice. He made a transition from heavy metal to hip hop. In 1988, he started rapping after being influenced by his older brother, rapper Ill Bill. Necro derived his stage-name from the Slayer song 'Necrophiliac'. Before that he called himself 'Mad Mooney', which was a character from a Clive Barker book. He made his first demo in about 1990 and won a demo battle contest on the Stretch Armstrong and Bobbito show on WKCR-FM. In about 1993 Necro started rapping full-time and made a demo called 'Do The Charles Manson'. In 1995 he proceeded to rap on the Wildman Steve and DJ Riz show WBAU 90.3FM.

Necro plays a hip-hop subgenre called horrorcore. He has played rap metal and has combined rap with death metal music. Necro refers to his music as 'death rap' to describe his style of ultraviolent hip hop and to distinguish himself from other genre labels created by the media. His music combines death metal beats with explicit raps about violence, death, the occult, drugs and sex.

Necro is known for releasing conceptual songs. Songs have tackled topics like the Manson murders: 'Creepy Crawl' 'Cockroaches', 'Scalpel', 'The 12 King Pimp Commandments', 'Dead Body Disposal', 'The Human Traffic King', 'White Slavery' 'I Need Drugs', 'Food For Thought', 'S.T.D.', picking up women ('86 Measures of Game'), cannibalism ('Human Consumption'), suicide ('You Did It'), bondage and sex games ('EdgePlay'), watersports and micturition ('Piss'), life as a pimp ('Out the Pocket'), a revenge tale ('Some Get Back (Revenge)'), and war narratives ('First Blood').

Necro is a devoted fan of the 1983 film Scarface. Necro sampled the main character from Scarface, Tony Montana, in 'Cockroaches'. Necro has also rapped, 'I live scarface scenes' in 'Gory Days', and rapped Montana's infamous quote, 'you fuck with me you fucking with the best', whilst sampling the quote simultaneously in 'asBESTos'. Necro also took the title from 'Push It to the Limit' which appeared in the film's soundtrack and used the title for his own song 'Push it to the Limit'. Al Pacino's work besides Scarface plays a recurrent theme throughout Necro's work. Necro's new collaboration with Kool G Rap is called The Godfathers as is the movie The Godfather that made a star of Al Pacino. In 'asBESTos', Necro raps, 'I'm completely rehabilitated, reinvigorated, reassimilated' which is taken directly from an Al Pacino quote in Carlito's Way.", image: "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wQUp4rTRL._SX355_.jpg")
Artist.create!(name: "Gravediggaz", bio: "Gravediggaz was an American hip-hop group from New York City, known for its dark sense of humor and abrasive, menacing soundscapes. Gravediggaz blended hardcore hip hop, gangsta rap and heavy metal with horror elements to pioneer the hip-hop subgenre of horrorcore. 

The group was formed in 1992, bringing together Prince Paul (The Undertaker), Frukwan (The Gatekeeper), Poetic (The Grym Reaper) and RZA (The RZArector). It came about largely due to the efforts of Prince Paul. Frukwan and Prince Paul were previously together in the group Stetsasonic. According to Frukwan, the group's name means 'digging graves of the mentally dead, and it stood for resurrecting the mentally dead from their state of unawareness and ignorance.' The group's lyrics mix black humor (regarding topics such as suicide, death, killing, psychopathy, hell, etc.), criticism regarding the music industry, cartoonish violence reminiscent of the Geto Boys, and esoteric references to the Nation of Gods and Earths. The group pioneered the horrorcore genre.

The group's first album was originally to be titled Niggamortis; however, this potentially risqué title was changed to 6 Feet Deep for the American market (European versions of the album retained the original title, and also included the bonus track 'Pass the Shovel'); it was released on August 9, 1994. The four members adopted Gravedigga alter egos for their work with the group: RZA became The RZArector, Poetic became The Grym Reaper, Prince Paul became The Undertaker, and Frukwan became The Gatekeeper. In 1995, the three rapping members (without Prince Paul) released a collaborative EP titled 'The_Hell_E.P.' with UK trip hop artist Tricky.

The second full-length Gravediggaz album The Pick, the Sickle and the Shovel was less humorous, dealing more with social and political issues; it also used calmer and more conventional production. Prince Paul played a considerably smaller role in the making of this album, with many of the production duties now taken care of by RZA and his Wu-Tang affiliates (including True Master and 4th Disciple).

A bootleg Gravediggaz album surfaced in 1998, called Scenes From The Graveyard. It featured seven unreleased tracks plus some remixes from the first two albums.

Gravediggaz recruited DJ Diamond J. Poetic died of colon cancer in July 2001. Frukwan stated in an interview not long after Poetic's death that a new album using leftover Poetic material would be released. Nightmare in A-Minor, the third official album for Gravediggaz, came out in 2001; it featured two of the original members, Poetic and Frukwan. This album was their darkest work yet, including many references to Poetic's struggle with cancer, as well as apocalyptic themes to do with the teachings of the Five Percent Nation. Although RZA did not take part in the album, some Wu-Tang Clan affiliates such as 4th Disciple, True Master and Beretta 9 were involved. The album was mostly produced by Poetic and Frukwan. A different version of the album (minus the song 'Better Wake Up') was released in 2002, for which some of the tracks created by Poetic were replaced or altered.

In 2003 Frukwan released his debut solo album, Life. The fourth Gravediggaz album 6 Feet Under was released in 2004 by Cleopatra Records and featured songs from Nightmare in A-Minor and Life. According to Frukwan, he had nothing to do with the release and claimed that song titles were changed without permission, making it an unauthorized release.

In 2010, Gravediggaz recorded a new song, '2 More Cups of Blood'. In 2011, it was announced that the group had been recording new tracks involving Shabazz The Disciple & Killah Priest.

In 2018, Gatekeeper released '1 Cup of Blood' under the Gravediggaz name.", image: "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wQUp4rTRL._SX355_.jpg")

Twiztid's debut album, Mostasteless, was originally released independently by Psychopathic in 1997, but was pulled, then re-released a year later on Twiztid's new label; Island with a somewhat different track listing as a result of uncleared samples in a few songs in the original release.

Artist.create!(name: "Tech N9ne", bio: "Aaron Dontez Yates (born November 8, 1971 in Kansas City, Missouri), better known by his stage name Tech N9ne or Tecca Nina is an American rapper, co-owner of Strange Music Records and actor. His career has spanned over 24 years, during which he has released eleven albums. According to the He's a Mental Giant Songfacts, his stage name originated from the TEC-9 semi-automatic handgun, given to him by rapper Black Walt due to his fast rhyming style. (Tech is short for technique and 9 is the number of completion. That's why he says the technique's complete so often.)

His tenth studio album, K.O.D., was released October 27, 2009. He has spent his illustrious career making sure he`s been grinding harder than the average rapper, and is the best selling artist out of his hometown. With nine solo albums and two powerhouse collaboration projects under his belt, the Kansas City MC`s flow is sharper and slicker than it`s ever been.
“This is another roller coaster ride,” explains TECH N9NE about the release. “When it came time for Sickology 101, I knew I wanted to do a collabo album based on the study of being sick. It`s a beginner`s course for people who don`t know how to be sick lyrically or how to choose sick beats. It all starts with beats because they tell me exactly what to do.” Epic beats from YoungFyre, Wyshmaster, Seven and Matic Lee set the stage for TECH N9NE to weave his introspective and sometimes roguish lyrics around.

Sickology 101 brims with stellar appearances from lyrical heavyweights. On the opening title track, TECH N9NE slays alongside Chino XL and Crooked I, pulling listeners into the Hip-Hop classroom for a lesson in murdering a beat. It`s a twisted vision forged on undeniable grooves and quixotic wordplay.

The single, “Nothin,`” is an inspiring, honest anthem that features Messy Marv and Big Scoob. Meanwhile, on “Midwest Choppers 2,” TECH N9NE and Krayzie Bone cruise to the depths of darkness. “Krayzie Bone came through and murdered it,” says TECH N9NE. “I modeled the song after movies. When you do a sequel, there has to be a bigger body count and more people have to die. ‘Midwest Choppers 2` is Autobahn-style. It makes you want to speed.”

TECH N9NE`s inimitable flow and rhyming take center stage on solo tracks, including the haunting, hypnotic “Red Nose.” He doesn`t pull any punches on the vitriolic, YoungFyre-produced “Blown Away,” either. It`s an open letter to several prominent urban artists who refused to play before him at radio festivals despite his massive concert draw.

With hits like “I`m A Playa,” “Caribou Lou” (which boasts 7.2 million MySpace plays), “Riotmaker,” “Like Yeah” and “Everybody Move,” it`s no wonder TECH N9NE counts a total of over 4.5 million YouTube video plays and an average of 40,000 MySpace visitors each day. His success knows no limits. The July 2008 release, Killer, debuted at Number 1 on the Billboard Top Independent Albums chart and Number 12 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart. He did it all on his own. There was no major label — just TECH N9NE`s own record company, Strange Music. TECH N9NE`s tracks have appeared in films like Gang Related and Alpha Dog as well as various TV shows, and he recently made his motion picture debut in The Life of Lucky Cucumber alongside members of MTV`s “Jackass” crew.

It hasn`t been an easy road, but TECH N9NE soldiers on and he`ll never stop. “They call me devil worshipper because I`m different. I give you music for my core. They`re the people that put me over the million mark. I raise my middle finger to everybody who judges me because my core audience is there for me. They will always love me, but I`m trying to reach others, too. It`s not over. My music is supposed to be for everybody, but some people just don`t get it. This album is the result; swallow it. It`s middle finger music, all-day and all-night.”

TECH N9NE never stops bringing that music directly to his fans, constantly reinforcing his status as one of the hardest-touring rap acts in the business. In 2008, TECH N9NE performed over 200 shows and he doesn`t show any signs of slowing down in 2009. In April, TECH will head out in support of Sickology 101 and spend two months on the road, performing live for his rabid fans.

Sickology 101 is prepping the world for TECH N9NE`s next masterpiece, K.O.D. “I want people to know that I`m getting better and better and I`m a machine. I do these collabo albums to give the fans more. This is a bridge record to K.O.D. It`s the farewell to the TECH N9NE you`ve known lately. It`s getting darker. A lot of people might not be able to go to the place I`m going, but this place is my specialty.”

“I don`t need people to kiss my hand,” assures TECH N9NE. “I`m not trippin` on status, and I`m not a narcissist when it comes to rap. It`s my heart and soul pouring onto the paper. I write my life and I can`t hold back. This is what I know.”", image: "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Tech-N9ne-2018-cr-denny-illic-billboard-1548.jpg")

Artist.create!(name: "Brotha Lynch Hung", bio: "Brotha Lynch Hung (born Kevin Mann) is an MC and producer from Sacramento, CA who began rapping at 13. Lynch Hung's lyrics are notorious for featuring highly explicit themes, including murder, rape and cannibalism. Lynch Hung debuted with the 1993 album 24 Deep, which featured stories of the struggles involved with being affiliated with a local street gang in Sacramento's 'Garden Blocc.' Lynch Hung has also helped Master P with albums like I'm Bout It, E-40's Southwest Riders and Mr. Serv-On's Life Insurance. Lynch's first known work is his production for X-Raided's 'Niggas In Blacc' (91) and the callaboration album 'Nigga Deep' with Triple Sicx Bounty, released in 1992 and re-released in 1998.

Brotha Lynch Hung has been described as the creator of the 'horrorcore rap genre', and has sold 1.4 million cds independently. His rapping style has been described as smooth and quickly delivered.

Some listeners argue that Lynch Hung's 24 Deep album defines his musical style, but Lynch Hung has said in interviews and online forums that it does not.

Lynch Hung's second album Season of Da Siccness in 1995 proved to be the one of the most gruesome and mysogynistic Gangsta Rap albums ever released, graphically chronicling a life of drug use and sale, promiscuity, ultra-violence, rape, infanticide, and supposed cannibalism. This is Lynch's most commercially successful album, as it has now achieved gold album sales status.

Lynch Hung's lyrics are described as sicc -\ having the same meaning as the word sick but utilizing the double 'C' which is characteristic of local Crip gangsters (loccs) in Sacramento, CA and other parts of California. Lynch has stated in his song '24 Gone' that he himself is a Crip, residing in Crip areas of Sacramento has had an influence on his lyrics. He has been in gang confrontations, and he was shot once. He describes his real life experiences in his lyrics. He has since released Loaded in 1997. The next Lynch album was released in 2000 called EBK4 after a dispute with Black Market Records. The label allegedly restricted his creativity by featuring artists on the album against Lynch's will. Lynch asked his fans not to buy the album. He said 'I don't care how they get it just don't buy it or steal it'. Brotha Lynch released the DVD of Now Eat in 2000, which features a bloodthirsty and cannibalistic Lynch who goes on a rampage, killing and eating many people.

Lynch released Blocc Movement and Virus in 2001, Appearances: Book 1 in 2002, and in that same summer of 2002 he released his first DVD, Plague. Lynch's newer work includes Lynch by Inch: Suicide Note and Uthanizm in 2003, and the Now Eat DVD in 2000. In 2006 he released a collaboration with rapper MC Eiht entitiled 'The New Season.'

In May 2009, Mann signed a three album deal with Midwest rapper Tech N9ne's Strange Music label. In March 2010, he released his Strange Music debut, Dinner and a Movie, selling around 7,000 copies during its first week. His second Strange album, Coathanga Strangla, was released a year later in April 2011, and his third album with Strange Music, Mannibalector was released on February 5, 2013. The Horror-inspired trilogy told a fictional story of a crazed cannibalistic serial killer, struggling with life, family and the urge to kill. Each album debuted on the Billboard 200, and featured acts such as Snoop Dogg, Yelawolf, Hopsin and Tech N9ne among others. Following the release of the third album, Strange Music offered Mann a contract extension to keep him on the label.", image: "https://bandwagmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Lynch-Blood-All-Over-Me-1.jpg")
Artist.create!(name: "Dark Lotus", bio: "Dark Lotus is an American hip-hop supergroup based in Detroit, Michigan. Formed in 1998, the group consists of Psychopathic Records-associated rappers Joseph Bruce and Joseph Utsler of Insane Clown Posse, Jamie Spaniolo and Paul Methric of Twiztid, and Blaze Ya Dead Homie.

Dark Lotus made its debut with the single 'Echo Side', which was later released on Insane Clown Posse's 1999 album The Amazing Jeckel Brothers. It was later announced that each member 'would act as a 'petal' of the lotus,' and that there would be six members. After speculation as to who the sixth member would be, including rumors that Esham would join the group, it was announced that Marz would be a member.
  
Dark Lotus released their first album, Tales from the Lotus Pod, in 2001. Mike E. Clark was brought in to produce the album, but left the project after producing four songs, and Fritz the Cat produced the rest of the album. The album peaked at #1 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart, #6 on the Top Independent Albums chart, and #158 on the Billboard 200. Marz left the group, and was replaced by James Lowery. In 2002, Tales from the Lotus Pod was reissued in a new version removing Marz' vocals. On April 6, 2004, Dark Lotus released their second studio album, Black Rain.

It peaked at #4 on the Top Independent Albums chart, #23 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, #45 on the Top Internet Albums chart, and #45 on the Billboard 200. Allrovi reviewer Stewart Mason praised the album, writing 'Nothing on The Opaque Brotherhood will convince anyone who isn't already a fan, but the tormented lyrics and matter-of-fact delivery remove a layer or two of distance and artifice from the band's familiar themes, and make them that much more disturbing as a result.'.", image: "https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/ar0/4979182ee8f847a6c72ac1e82003a25a.jpg")

Tac and Hash continued to write songs in their own unique style. Although their music was mainly influenced by hip-hop, its intensity suggests the presence of a rock influence as well.

Their 2007 album entitled Truth In Lies is one of their most lyrically advanced albums to date and features some of the underground's most popular artists.

Artist.create!(name: "ADR Lavey", bio: "San Francisco native born and raised, started off as a DJ. Then I was recruited by a local group Polynesian Posse and at 16 was when I first stepped into a recording studio. Was approached by a childhood friend to do production and DJ work for. Friend and that's when Triple 666 was created.

Process of us recording the album little by little I started approaching the mic and I've been on the mic ever since. I bring a dark entity to the music. I try to take you on an emotional roller coaster and paint a real graphic picture for my fans.
  
Triple 666 was founded at Bank Roll Studios in San Francisco in 1991, by Fila Phil, Undertaker and myself. Then we picked Face Dog and SOS, as of now the group is no longer together, but everyone is just a phone call away if we decide we want to do any projects together.
  
“Nothing But Reality” was never pressed in a CD format. That project consisted of a few songs, the majority of the songs just featured Fila Phil only, the rest of the group was only in one song. We were testing the waters to see how people would react to it. What can be heard is a lot of street tales, from drug dealing, murder and pimp tales.

Artist.create!(name: "Anybody Killa", bio: "James Lowery (born June 26, 1973), also known as Anybody Killa, or ABK, is a rapper from Detroit, Michigan, whose stage persona is that of a Native American warrior. He is signed to Psychopathic Records. Prior to performing as ABK he performed as Native Funk.

Lowery was raised on the east side of Detroit. His parents were from Pembroke, North Carolina. Lowery's father was a preacher. His aunt and mother taught him about Native American heritage, telling him Cherokee and Lumbee legends and teaching him about dreamcatchers. Lowery started making music at a young age, using anything he could find as instruments, and began writing his own songs at the age of 13. By the age of 15, local kids were paying to watch him perform in his garage.

In 1995, he formed the group Krazy Klan with childhood friend Lavel, performing as Jaymo and J-ho, respectively. During this period, Lowery worked at a side plant that produced parts for Chrysler. His middle finger was partially cut off in an accident. After releasing two albums independently and performing at local clubs and parties, Krazy Klan broke up.

Since going solo, Lowery has released one album under the alias Native Funk, countless solo albums as ABK, as well as working on collaborative group albums with fellow emcees — Drive-By with Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Detroit Warriors with Strict 9, and The Hav Knots with Big Hoodoo.

He has also been a part of the supergroup Dark Lotus and went on to form another record label, Native World Inc., releasing albums from various other artists throughout the years.", image: "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/rap/images/6/69/Abk.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130520210450")

Artist.create!(name: "Army of the Pharaohs", bio: "Army of the Pharaohs (most commonly abbreviated as AOTP or A.O.T.P.) is an American underground hip hop collective originating from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, formed by Jedi Mind Tricks founder Vinnie Paz in 1998. The collective has strong links to other underground east coast groups such as Outerspace, Snowgoons, La Coka Nostra, Demigodz, 7L & Esoteric, and JuJu Mob. AOTP's affiliations and member roster has changed several times since its formation.

Paz formed the outfit in the late 1990s with the original roster of Bahamadia, Chief Kamachi, Virtuoso, 7L & Esoteric, plus Jedi Mind Tricks' other member Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind. The group first released the “Five Perfect Exertions” and “War Ensemble” 12″ on Paz's short-lived Recordings in 1998, but then the underground supergroup remained silent for several years.

After a couple of successful Jedi Mind Tricks albums and a new deal with Babygrande by 2003, Paz resurrected the crew, adding OuterSpace, Celph Titled, Reef the Lost Cauze, King Syze, Des Devious, and Apathy; however, Stoupe, Bahamadia, and Virtuoso had defected from the group. Babygrande issued their “Tear It Down” 12″ and first album, The Torture Papers, in 2006. The 2007 follow-up album, Ritual of Battle, saw Jus Allah and JMT protégés Doap Nixon and Demoz joining the Pharaohs.

The Unholy Terror was released in March 2010. This album marked the return of Apathy and the addition of two new AOTP members, Block McCloud and Journalist. Two songs, “Godzilla” and “Contra Mantra”, were released before the album. This album also marked the departure of Chief Kamachi who left the group because of business issues and an apparent feud with Vinnie Paz and Apathy.

In early 2011, Paz announced on his Facebook page that In Death Reborn is due to be released in 2012, however the date was pushed back and almost seemed like it was never going to be released. Early in 2012, Houston underground MC VZilla and Connecticut's Blacastan were added to the group. Both artists have made names for themselves with their features and album releases in 2012. In Death Reborn was eventually released in April 2014. The album featured members Vinnie Paz, Apathy, Blacastan, Block McCloud, Celph Titled, Demoz, Des Devious, Doap Nixon, Esoteric, Lawrence Arnell, King Magnetic, King Syze, OuterSpace, Reef the Lost Cauze, and VZilla.

Artist.create!(name: "A-Game", bio: "A-Game is a recording artist originally from Bradenton, Florida hailing from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Pursuing a career in music was a dream that A-Game had since he was only 5 years old. At age 14, that dream quickly became reality when he began investing into recording equipment, actively seeking out criticism of his early work from peers who weren't afraid to hurt feelings and be brutally honest, which was something an introverted, shy teen just starting out needed to hear to improve.

Eventually, A-Game reunited with an old friend from high school who recently just got out of juvenile hall known as The Bird, and began making music on an almost daily basis under the group Zoo Crew, which had over 20 members at one point in time. Shortly after, Bird and A-Game began forming their own supergroup, known as “Skrewz Loose” which was a duo group formed by the two. At age 16, his first time performing live was when Hopsin pulled him onstage to rap next to him in front of a sold out show of 2,000 plus people. A nerve-racking experience, but this ultimately was A-Game's breakthrough. By that time next year, he was already doing shows in his local Florida scene, dominating stages in Saint Petersburg, Tampa, Orlando, and more.
  
In 2017, A-Game became an official member of Judah Priest (Wu-Tang Clan's Brooklyn Zu/Zu Bulliez)'s 144,000 Chosen Few, beginning to do shows more frequently in the northeast and quickly building a following in the Philly/New Jersey hip hop scene. In 2019, A-Game left the Chosen Few to pursue his own path.
  
Fast forward to now, he has performed multiple times in over half the United States of America. He currently has 5 mixtapes released, and 2 albums.

Artist.create!(name: "Bake Lo", bio: "Charles baker (born on march 1st, 1994), better known by his stage name Bake Lo, has been quoted to be one of the hardest working artists around. Not only because of the immense energy that he brings to the stage and microphone, but also because of what he does behind the scenes. He has a willingness to work that leave some intimidated. This artist comes hardcore with an intricate but clear way of rhyming with his very own, unique style of music. Growing up in the small but mighty city of Ecorse, MI wasn't always easy. Other than being located on the outskirts of Detroit, the city was riddled with problems.

Growing up in a low income household taught Bake the struggles of adulthood early on in his life. Between having to start working at a young age to help his family's income and living in a household that was on the verge of falling apart; he learned. He learned that life was going to be a roller coaster that he might not be able to hold on to. Regardless, he did not let it stop him. He was soon introduced to the idea of making music by his childhood friend Bradly Gibson (RIP), who originally got Bake Lo into recording his first few songs. At first, the songs were nonsense because Bake couldn't quite find his sound. It wasn't until he was arrested at age 15 and sent to a juvenile facility to really reflect on his life when he finally channeled his inner emotion into his writing,

At that point, he began to feel a release when writing about his life and the struggles around him. It was soon that he began to master his unique sound of Wicked Truth. He was eventually introduced to an artist by the name of Ikkurruz that really helped Bake Lo get the initial push that he needed. He officially booked Bake Lo for his first show in 2011 and Bake made sure that he sold every single ticket that he was given, plus more, which lead to bigger opportunities. One opportunity in which he met his soon to be (Native World Inc) label partner, Anybody Killa. Leaving behind his job at a liquor store, Bake Lo did his first national tour at the age of 17 with ABK and Blaze Ya Dead Homie as Drive By. He later went on to do countless tours and shows throughout the span of a couple years with many other artists.", image: "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6761610000e5eb860a9f73cf95cc27226a1ab7")

Artist.create!(name: "Bankrupt Records", bio: "Bankrupt Records began as a closet experiment in rural Georgia, as brothers James G and JG (collectively known as DUO) began creating music out of their closet with limited funds and no financial support. The duo created Bankrupt Records, a launchpad to release music and named it so for the lack of money and finances involved in creating the music.

The DUO collaborated with local artists, such as the Medicine Man and Big C, and released a 2005 album titled “Underground Mythology.” Bankrupt Records would begin performing live and began spreading their influence across Georgia and the Southeast. Bankrupt soon teamed up with the rap group Southern Hustlas Incorporated (SHI) based out of Covington, Georgia and released a super group album titled “The League” featuring Bankrupt, SHI, and West Virginia artist Sike Sick. This album was very successful and sold thousands of physical units and lead to Bankrupt opening shows for acts such as D12, Twiztid, Hed PE, Kottonmouth Kings, Blaze, ABK, and Gangsta Boo, and performing at musical festivals such as Strictly for the Wicked and The Gathering.

Bankrupt would then release their first all DUO project, “Night Vision,” and would continue to tour the underground scene in the Southeast, hitting local pubs, bars, parties, and bigger venues. Bankrupt Records would then release their first professionally recorded studio album, “Double Vision,” featuring appearances from Hopsin, Bizarre, Bizzy Bone, Lil Wyte, Royce da 5'9″, and others, and would go on to do extremely well and further their influence across the South.

Bankrupt also released another GA compilation titled “Gods and Generals” and helped shed light on rising talent such as Rittz by providing a mixtape to push and shows to network and perform on.

Then he attempted to kill himself twice. The funny part is that both times music saved his life. The first was a song called “Gore Hop,” which was rapped by both Hex Rated and Insane Poetry.
  
And the second time was from Statik G's ALL OUT OF NORMAL album. However, this was never in his playlist. It just was randomly added. The song that saved his life from that album was “Night Without End.”

Artist.create!(name: "Bootleg", bio: "Dayton Family founder Bootleg not only made a name for himself in the Midwest hardcore rap underground as a member of the infamous Flint, MI, group but also as a solo artist. While many MCs rap about crime and the gangsta lifestyle, few can actually back up their talk. No stranger to crime or prison, Bootleg is one of the few hardcore rappers who speaks directly from experience. It's this sincerity and experience that sets him apart from his wannabe peers, making him one of the Midwest's most notorious hardcore rappers.

After joining forces with fellow Flint MCs Shoestring and Matt Hinkle, Bootleg tagged the trio the Dayton Family in commemoration of the shady, crime-ridden street they called home. By 1995 the trio had released their first album, What's on My Mind?, followed a year later by the gold-selling F.B.I. While both albums generated a substantial amount of attention and hype in the underground hardcore rap scene, the law unfortunately intervened, and the group members soon found themselves behind bars for various crimes. Of course, prison wasn't a new experience for Bootleg. In fact, he'd spent the greater part of the '90s behind bars, accumulating priceless experiences that fueled his criminal-minded rhymes.
  
Once Bootleg finally got out of prison, he used every free moment to work on his solo debut, 1999's Death Before Dishonesty. Unfortunately, partly because of the three-year interval since F.B.I., Bootleg's debut didn't sell as well as hoped for, and Relativity Records quickly parted ways with the troubled rapper. In 2001, Bootleg returned to the rap game, though, joining forces with the Detroit-based Overcore label (Esham, Natas).

Over the last 5 or so years as of this writing, Tha Butcher has consistently evolved, expanded, and broadened his skill level as far as lyrics, content, and overall variety of styles.
  
His drive and motivation has led to him getting signed to Klinikly Dead Entertainment as of early 2021.
  
His “go to” is, has been, and always will be, tha dark side.
  
His literal intelligence and knowledge level of “certain things” we'll just say, is indicated and hinted at, throughout his entire career.
  
With an extensive criminal record and 3 decades worth of inpatient hospitalizations, it's definitely safe to say, Tha Butcher is not only an artist, but a human/demon hybrid, that you would definitely want on your side, and/or on your team.
  
This is 110% an individual you do NOT want to confront in real life.
  
The lyrics are not a gimic by any means. This is real life self expression, of what has ALREADY BEEN, seen, done, or thought about.
  
No longer the “new guy” in the underground, Tha Butcher has made it his life's mission, to not only EARN but to COMMAND his respect.
Not only in music, but in life.
  
Tha Butcher takes this VERY seriously.
  
And his music, will ALWAYS be, a reflection of his REAL LIFE STORY.

He started horrorcore music at a very young age when he was in the 8th grade in the year of 2006; he progressed more and more until he became serious with his music and started recording it for the first time when he graduated out of High School in the year of 2010. He had contacted with a local producer named Soerangit Aniff aka Mo from his hometown of San Jose, CA who actually has been working with a lot of well known talented MCs including Kung Fu Vampire (once) and producing beats. Chuckklez started out with one of his very dark tracks that he wrote “Mental Patient©” which is actually an influence by real life Psychopaths, Murderers and parts of his childhood memories. But he wanted it to be kept in the darkness until the time was right and started writing more Sick music for his pleasure. Since then in 2011, he finally released it along with a new track “Keep the Heads and Eat the Rest©” which was inspired by the movie Sin City and became well known in the underground today.
  
He has worked and collaborated with one of the most well known and talented MCs from the U.S. to overseas such as Scum, Insane Poetry, Dosia Demon, DJ Lil Sprite, Zomb' G, Skyler Torquemada (Italy), Kaotic Klique, Dark Half, Legacey, Wolff, Phr0zen, Omega Sin, Insane Loc, Bloodshot, KGP, MC Cumblood from Butchers Harem, 089 Clique, Rozz Dyliams, and much much more.
